The Higher Education Loan Programme (HELP) was introduced on 1 January 2005, replacing the HECS. HELP consists of: (1) HECS-HELP -  for eligible students enrolled in Commonwealth supported places. A HECS-HELP loan will cover all or part of their student contribution. (2) FEE-HELP - for eligible fee-paying students enrolled at an eligible higher education provider. FEE-HELP provides students with a loan to cover up to the full amount of their tuition fees. (3) OS-HELP - for eligible Commonwealth supported students who wish to study overseas. OS-HELP provides students with a loan to cover expenses such as accommodation and travel. If the Australian Government lends you money under any of these schemes you will have a HELP debt.</link:label>

		<link:label xlink:label="lbl_DE25" xlink:role="http://sbr.gov.au/fdtn/sbr.01.02.tech/businessDefinition" xlink:type="resource" xml:lang="en">Indicates whether the tax payer has a Student Financial Supplement Scheme, which is a voluntary loan scheme for tertiary students to help cover their expenses while they studied. Five years after the loan is taken out the Tax Office becomes responsible for collecting the outstanding loan, and the loan becomes an accumulated Financial Supplement debt. Compulsory repayments of accumulated Financial Supplement debts are made through the tax system when the payee&apos;s taxable income is above the minimum threshold.
Note: The Student Financial Supplement Scheme closed on 31 December 2003 and no new loans are being issued. There are no changes to the collection of existing financial supplement debts, which will continue to be collected through the tax system.</link:label>
