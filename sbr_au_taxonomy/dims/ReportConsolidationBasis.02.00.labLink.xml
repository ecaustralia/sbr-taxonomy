The Domestic books of the registered entity relates to the Australian books of the Australian entity and has the following scope: 

     - this applies on a consolidated basis for all legal entities in your Australian enterprise group that are applicable; 

     - do not consolidate Australian and offshore controlled entities or associated entities that are not applicable; 

     - exclude offshore branches of the Australian registered entity from this reporting unit; and

     - report your Australian consolidated entity's operations/transactions that are booked inside Australia.

Arrangements may be negotiated with APRA for less consolidated reporting.</link:label>
