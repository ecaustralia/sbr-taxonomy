The total capital requirement for interest rate risk consists of charges for specific risk, general market risk, and interest rate-sensitive options risks.

The data to be entered into Table 2 should be calculated according to the methodology detailed in APS 116. These calculations should be performed and the results reported separately for each currency (without offsetting across currencies) in which material interest rate exposures are held, and in aggregate for all currencies in which interest rate exposures are not material.
APS 116 allows the choice between three methods for the calculation of general market risk (the maturity, duration and pre-processing methods). The pre-processing method should only be used with APRA approval. For each currency, specify the method used in calculating the capital charge. If more than one method is being used for a currency, report the calculations for each method on a different currency and method combination table. APS 116 allows the offsetting of positions between the duration and pre-processing methods. ADIs performing such offsetting should report those positions (netted across the two methods) as pre-processing positions.

The total general market risk charge is to be reported for each currency and method combination. This is the sum of the net position and vertical and horizontal disallowances (calculated in accordance with APS 116 and APG 116).</link:label>
