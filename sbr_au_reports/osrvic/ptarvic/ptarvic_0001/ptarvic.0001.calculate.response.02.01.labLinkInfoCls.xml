The total wages which are taxable under Victorian legislation before subtraction of the allowable deduction. The definition of 'wages' is very broad and is not restricted to ordinary earnings. The term 'wages' includes salaries/wages, allowances, bonuses/commissions, contractor payments, directors fees, fringe benefits, superannuation, termination payments and shares/options. Wages do not have to be paid directly by an employer to an employee in order to be taxable. Exempt wages do not need to be advised with the lodgement.</link:label>

A deduction is populated into the annual reconciliation and cannot be amended. Ordinary group members and  employers with a 'deduction denied' are not entitled to a deduction. The deduction an employer is entitled to claim may vary according to whether the employer is a member of a group or an interstate employer. 

Group employers
Employers who are members of a group are not all entitled to a deduction. Only one member who is designated by the group (the designated group employer) is entitled to claim a deduction on behalf of the group. The other members (the ordinary members) are not entitled to claim any deduction and must pay tax on their total Victorian wages. 

Interstate employers
Employers or groups of employers who also pay Interstate wages are only entitled to a partial deduction in Victoria. This partial deduction is the maximum deduction, adjusted by the ratio of the total Victorian taxable wages to total Australian wages.</link:label>
