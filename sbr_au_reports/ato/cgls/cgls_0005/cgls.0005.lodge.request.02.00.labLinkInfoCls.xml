For each joining company that transferred a same business test tax loss or same business test net capital loss to the head company, determine the year of income in which the joining company first failed the continuity of ownership or control tests.

'Same' means 'identical' and not merely 'similar'. The term 'same business' is to be read as referring to the same business, in the sense of the identical business. However, the term does not mean identical in all respects. A company may expand or contract its activities without necessarily ceasing to carry on the same business. The organic growth of a business does not necessarily cause the business to fail the same business test provided the business retains its identity. However, if through a process of evolution a business changes its essential character, the entity may fail the test. Application of the same business test is a question of fact and is usually determined by a process of weighing up various relevant factors.
For more information, see sections 165-13 and 165-210 of the ITAA 1997, Taxation Ruling TR 999/9 and Taxation Ruling TR 2007/2.

The aim of it is to find out (in respect of companies that transferred losses to a head company of a consolidated group because a same business transfer test was satisfied):
- the period of time between the year of failure of the continuity of ownership or control transfer tests and the trial year, and
- the losses that failed the continuity of ownership or control tests at the joining time and in the trial year.

When a company joins a consolidated group any unused carry forward losses are transferred to the head company if the losses could have been deducted/applied by the joining entity, assuming sufficient income or gains in the 'trial year', which generally begins 12 months before joining the consolidated group and ends immediately after the joining time. In certain circumstances, the trial year may be a shorter period than 12 months. See subsection 707-120(2) of the ITAA 1997.</link:label>

The Same Business Test is one of the three tests in Section 165-210 (the same business test, the new business test, and the new transaction test). The same business test, which is the primary test, is a positive test: it looks to see whether the business of the company in the year of recoupment is actually the same business that was carried on at the change-over. The same business test is intended to ensure continuing identity between the whole of the business activities carried on by the taxpayer at the change-over and the whole of the business activities carried on by the taxpayer during the period of recoupment.</link:label>

The trust loss legislation in Schedule 2F to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (ITAA 1936) affects the deductibility of prior year tax losses by trusts.
The measures generally apply from 7.30pm Australian Eastern Standard Time on 9 May 1995. The legislation applies to two broad categories of trusts:
fixed trusts - see section 272-65 of Schedule 2F to the ITAA 1936
non-fixed trusts (including discretionary trusts) defined in section 272-70 of Schedule 2F to the ITAA 1936.</link:label>
