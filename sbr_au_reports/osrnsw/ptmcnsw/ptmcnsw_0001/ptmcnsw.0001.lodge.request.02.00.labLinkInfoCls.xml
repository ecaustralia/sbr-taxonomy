From 1 July 2009 to 31 December 2009 the tax rate is 5.75 per cent.
From 1 January 2010 the tax rate is 5.65 per cent. 
From 1 July 2009 the threshold is $638,000. 

Your monthly threshold is calculated using the number of days in the month, divided by the number of days in the year, multiplied by the threshold. 
  Days in months      Threshold 
         28                   $48,942 
         30                   $52,438 
         31                   $54,186  

However, if you paid any liable interstate wages it reduces the  threshold entitlement applied to the gross NSW wages.
Only one member of the group can claim the group&apos;s NSW threshold entitlement.
This member is known as the Designated Group Employer (DGE). Grouped employers are required to nominate a DGE for their group. This must be a group member with Australian wages exceeding the threshold.

If you are not the DGE, you do not receive any threshold entitlement. If none of the members have Australian wages exceeding the threshold, you must nominate a single lodger to be responsible for lodging and paying payroll tax on behalf of all members of the group.

Calculation:
Threshold Entitlement = ( (Total NSW Wages +  Gross NSW wages paid by other group members) / Total Australian Wages) * ( (Number of days in the period / Number of days in year) * Threshold) </link:label>

The other group members are not required to make individual payments or lodge an annual reconciliation. A request in writing must have been made and advice received from OSR of approval to be the nominated single lodger. 

A single lodger does not include an accountant or accounts clerk who may calculate the payroll tax payable and make payments on behalf of more than one company. In this instance, each individual company is still required to make their own payment to OSR and lodge their own annual reconciliation in July each year.  

The following checklist will assist you in determining whether you are a single lodger.
- Are you a member of a group? Yes/No 
- Have you received advice from OSR that you are a single lodger? Yes/No 
- Do you calculate the payroll tax payable by the group each month on behalf of all member of the group? Yes/No 
- Do you pay the total payroll tax payable for the group on behalf of all members of the group? Yes/No 
- Do the other group members advise you of their gross NSW wages and gross interstate wages each month? Yes/No 
- Out of all group members, are you the only group member that makes individual payments to OSR? Yes/No 
- Are you responsible for lodging the annual reconciliation and making the June payment on behalf of all group members? Yes/No        

If you answered &apos;yes&apos; to all the above questions, you are a single lodger.</link:label>
