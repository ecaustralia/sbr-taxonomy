It is one of the Capital Gains Tax (CGT) concessions available to small business. It allows an individual to disregard the capital gain made on an asset owned and actively used in the business for 15 years if they satisfy all the conditions.  If the small business 15-year exemption conditions are met,  the capital gain can be disregarded entirely and there is no need to apply any further concessions. Do to apply capital losses before you apply the 15-year exemption.  If the capital gain is from a depreciating asset, do not use the 15-year exemption.  Qualifying for the small business 15-year exemption means that the basic conditions for the small business CGT concessions are satisfied  (the asset must have been an active asset for at least half of the relevant 15-year period, not half of the full period of ownership), that the CGT asset was continuously owned for the 15-year period ending just before the CGT event, that as an individual in business, at the time of the CGT event the individual was 55 years or more and the event was connected with your retirement, or the individual was permanently incapacitated, that as an individual in business and the CGT asset is a share in a company or an interest in a trust, the company or trust had a controlling individual for the entire time you owned the share or interest (not necessarily the same individual for the whole period), or that as a company or trust, the company or trust had a controlling individual for the entire time it owned the CGT asset (not necessarily the same individual for the whole period).  Further, at the time of the CGT event the controlling individual must have been 55 years or more and the event must have been connected with their retirement, or they must have been permanently incapacitated. For CGT assets acquired or transferred under the rollover provisions relating to assets compulsorily acquired, lost or destroyed, or those relating to marriage breakdown, there are modified rules about the requirement that the asset be continuously owned for at least 15 years.</link:label>

Y= Yes, N=No. If a company in which an individual owned shares was taken over and that individual  received new shares in the takeover company, there may be an entitlement to scrip-for-scrip rollover. The individual may also be eligible for this rollover if the individual exchanged a unit or other interest in a fixed trust, for a similar interest in another fixed trust.  Scrip-for-scrip rollover is not available if a share is exchanged for a unit or other interest in a fixed trust, or if a unit or other interest in a fixed trust is exchanged for a share. The individual can only choose the rollover if that individual has made a capital gain from such an exchange on or after 10 December 1999.  Rollover does not apply to a capital loss. Rollover is only available if the exchange is in consequence of an arrangement that results in the acquiring entity (or the wholly owned group of which it is a member) becoming the owner of 80% or more of the original company or trust. For companies, the arrangement must be one in which all owners of voting shares in the original entity can participate.  For trusts, this means all owners of trust voting interests in the original entity or, if there are no voting interests, all owners of units or other fixed interests can participate. There are special rules if a company or trust has a small number of shareholders or beneficiaries or there is a significant common stakeholder.  If the company or trust does not let the individual know, further information will be required about whether the conditions have been satisfied.  The rollover allows the individual to disregard the capital gain made from the original shares, units or other interest. The individual is taken to have acquired the replacement shares, units or other interest for the cost base of the original interest. The individual can apply the CGT discount when disposing of new shares providing the combined period that the individual owned the original shares and the new shares is at least 12 months. The same applies to units in a trust. Note that the individual is required to deduct any capital losses (including unapplied net capital losses from earlier years) from any capital gains before applying the CGT discount. The individual may only be eligible for partial rollover if there is an  exchange of shares, units or interests for similar interests in another entity (replacement interest) plus something else, usually cash. This is because rollover applies only to the replacement interest. The individual will need to apportion the cost base of the original interest between the replacement interest and the cash (or other proceeds not eligible for rollover). If the individual's original shares, units or other interests were acquired before 20 September 1985 (pre-CGT), the individual is not eligible for scrip-for-scrip rollover. Instead, the individual will acquire the replacement interest at the time of the exchange and the replacement interest is no longer a pre-CGT asset. However, if the arrangement is one that would otherwise qualify for scrip-for-scrip rollover, the cost base of the replacement interest is its market value just after the acquisition.</link:label>

The cost base of a Capital Gains Tax (CGT) asset is generally the cost of the asset when  bought; however, it also includes certain other costs associated with acquiring, holding and disposing of the asset.
