true = the service channel does meet the minimum branch requirement.
false = the service channel does not meet the minimum branch requirement. 

To satisfy the minimum branch requirements, the following minimum face-to-face services must all be provided:-
- accepts cash and other deposits (including business deposits) and provides change;
-facilitates the keeping of accounts for customer access, including the provision of account balances;
-opens and closes accounts;
-can facilitate or arrange the assessment of the credit risk of existing and potential customers; and
-offers additional services in the one establishment such as financial services, business banking and specialist lending, if these are generally available from the authorised deposit-taking institution (ADI). This point need not mean that a financial adviser or business credit manager be available in the branch - the staff of the branch may simply act as a referral point for customers interested in these kinds of services.</link:label>
