- Warehouse ABCP, being warehouse structures that will predominately issue commercial paper with an original maturity of one year or less that is backed by assets or other exposures held in bankruptcy-remote, special purpose entity. Warehouses are structures that accumulate exposures until a sufficiently large pool is available for issuance of securities to the market in a securitisation.

- other Warehouse, being special purpose vehicles (SPVs) other than those deemed asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) warehouse SPVs.

- asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) securitisation programs. An ABCP program predominately issues commercial paper with an original maturity of one year or less that is backed by assets or other exposures held in bankruptcy-remote, special purpose entity.

- commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) securitisation programs.

- residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) securitisation programs.

- synthetic securitisation program, being a securitisation whereby only the credit risk, or part of the credit risk, of a pool is transferred to a third party, which need not necessarily be a SPV.
