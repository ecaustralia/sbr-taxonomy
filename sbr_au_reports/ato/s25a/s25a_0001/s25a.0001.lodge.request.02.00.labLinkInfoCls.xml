A derivative instrument is a contractual right that derives its value from the value of something else, such as a debt security, equity, commodity, or a specific index. The most common derivative instruments are forwards, futures, options and notional principal contracts such as swaps, caps, floors, collars and credit derivatives. Unlike traditional debt and equity securities, these instruments do not involve a return on an initial investment. For many derivative instruments such as notional principal contracts (for example, interest rate swaps), only net cash outgoings should be recorded. Do not record any gross cash flows or any notional principal amounts associated with such transactions. If only one party to the derivative instrument transaction has made a payment, record the gross amount here if it is an outgoing.

A financial transaction other than a loan is any other form of financial transaction that is not a derivative instrument or an amount to be recorded elsewhere in interest, discounts, insurance, interest-bearing and interest-free loans and that is of a revenue (non-capital) nature, should be recorded at this item.

A 'Y' answer would also be required where an Australian company owned a trademark that it allowed an international related party to use without payment.
A permanent establishment should be regarded as a separate, but related, party to that of the head office for the purposes of this item. Where there is no charge or adjustment allocating income or expenditure between the parties for a provision of services, transfer of property, or other transactions listed on Schedule 25A by:
- the head office to the permanent establishment, or

A statistical sample may be an appropriate method of calculating the relevant percentage, provided the sample selection and mathematical considerations are consistent with generally accepted statistical methods.

1 = Nil consideration, 2 = Cost price, 3 = Written-down value, 4 = Discounted cash flow, 5 = Director's valuation, 6 = Independent valuation, 7 = Quoted market price, 8 = Other methods
Where you have acquired capital assets from, or have disposed of capital assets to international related parties, use the codes to indicate the four principal methods you used for pricing those acquisitions or disposals. Use the codes to list the four principal methods used for pricing acquisitions and disposals you used, in descending order of total dollar value, starting at the left hand side. If you used fewer than four methods leave the remaining spaces blank.

Cost price refers to the price the seller originally paid for the asset, including ancillary costs such as freight or handling. Written-down value refers to a pricing method based on either the taxation 'adjustable value' or accounting residual value after depreciation has been allowed. Discounted cash flow is a pricing method where the price of an asset is based on the discounted cash flow at the time of acquisition or disposal. Director's valuation refers to a pricing method that is based on the directors' opinion of an asset's value, and not on any of the methods listed in codes 1 to 8. Independent valuation is a pricing method by which a suitably qualified person, acting at arm's length to both the buyer and seller, assesses the value of an asset. Quoted market price refers to a price quoted on a public listed market, such as a public stock exchange, or commodities market. Other methods means any other pricing method that is not mentioned here.</link:label>

See the ATO website for an explanation of the methods in Taxation Ruling TR 97/20 and Taxation Ruling TR 1999/1.

In order to establish appropriate arm's length pricing under a particular method, a sampling of the dealings may be sufficient if carried out according to accepted statistical practice. Note that where total dollar value of related-party dealings is to be calculated, these dealings should not be 'netted off' (other than in the case of certain derivative instruments). That is, do not set off incomings and outgoings against each other to result in a lesser amount. Instead, add the amounts, both income derived and expenses incurred, to obtain the sum total of all such dealings.</link:label>
