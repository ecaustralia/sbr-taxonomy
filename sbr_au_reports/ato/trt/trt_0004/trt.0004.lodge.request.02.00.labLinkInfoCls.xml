Small business entities who wish to do so can still conduct a stocktake and account for changes in the value of trading stock. If the difference between the value of opening stock and a reasonable estimate of closing stock is more than $5,000 the trust must account for the change in the value of the trading stock. If the difference referred to above is $5,000 or less and the trust chooses not to account for this difference, the closing stock value is the same as the value at Opening stock.

Generally, the expenditure is only deductible to the extent the business is, was or is proposed to be carried on for a taxable purpose. A deduction cannot be claimed for capital expenditure to the extent that it:
- can be deducted under another provision of the income tax laws
- forms part of the cost of a depreciating asset the Trust holds, used to hold or will hold
- forms part of the cost of land
- relates to a lease or other legal or equitable right
- would be taken into account in working out an assessable profit or deductible loss
- could be taken into account in working out a capital gain or a capital loss from a CGT event
- would be specifically not deductible under the income tax laws if the expenditure was not capital expenditure
- is specifically not deductible under the income tax laws for a reason other than that the expenditure is capital expenditure
- is of a private or domestic nature
- is incurred in relation to gaining or producing exempt income or non-assessable non-exempt income
- is excluded from the cost or cost base of an asset because, under special rules in the UCA or capital gains tax regimes respectively, the cost or cost base of the asset was taken to be the market value, or
- is a return of or on capital (for example, distributions by trustees) or a return of a non-assessable amount (for example, repayments of loan principal).
The Trust deducts 20% of the qualifying capital expenditure in the year it is incurred and in each of the following four years.</link:label>

A Trust can claim a deduction in the year it incurs capital expenditure on a landcare operation for land in Australia. Unless the trust is a rural land irrigation water provider, the deduction is available to the extent the Trust uses the land for either:
- a primary production business, or
- in the case of rural land, a business for the purpose of producing assessable income from the use of that land - except a business of mining or quarrying.
The Trust may claim the deduction even if it is only a lessee of the land. A rural land irrigation water provider is an entity whose business is primarily and principally supplying water to entities for use in primary production businesses on land in Australia or businesses (except mining or quarrying businesses) using rural land in Australia. A Trust cannot claim a deduction if the capital expenditure is on plant unless it is on certain fences, dams or other structural improvements.
A Trust can claim a deduction for the decline in value of a water facility. A water facility is plant or a structural improvement, or an alteration, addition or extension to plant or a structural improvement, that is primarily or principally for the purpose of conserving or conveying water. A deduction for the decline in value of a water facility can be claimed in equal instalments over three years. Unless the trust is an irrigation water provider, the expenditure must be incurred primarily and principally for conserving or conveying water for use in a primary production business the trust conducts on land in Australia. The trust may claim the deduction even if it is merely a lessee of the land. The deduction is reduced where the facility is not wholly used for either:
- carrying on a primary production business on land in Australia, or
- a taxable purpose - for example, producing assessable income.
An irrigation water provider is an entity whose business is primarily and principally the supply of water to entities for use in primary production businesses on land in Australia. If the Trust is an irrigation water provider, it must incur the expenditure primarily and principally for the purpose of conserving or conveying water for use in primary production businesses conducted by other entities on land in Australia - being entities supplied with water by the Trust.

1 Beneficiary details:
For resident beneficiaries show the name of the trustee beneficiary and their TFN. For non-resident beneficiaries show the name of the trustee beneficiary and their address.
2 TB statement Information
a) Set the field to TRUE to indicate you are making a TB statement for this trustee beneficiary.
b) At P show any tax-preferred amounts to which the trustee beneficiary is presently entitled. If there are no tax-preferred amounts, show zero at P.
c) At Q show any untaxed part of a share of net income to be included in the assessable income of the trustee beneficiary. If there is no untaxed part of a share of net income, show zero at Q.

Otherwise set the field to FALSE.  If TRUE, complete a PSI schedule. Personal services income (PSI) is income that is mainly a reward for an individual's personal efforts or skills (or would mainly be such a reward if it was derived by the individual).  A trust may derive income which includes the PSI of one or more individuals. Examples of PSI include:
- income for the services of a professional practitioner in a sole practice
- income derived under a contract which is wholly or principally for the labour or services of an individual
- income for the exercise of professional skills by a professional sportsperson or entertainer
- income for the exercise of personal expertise by a consultant.
PSI does not include income that is mainly:
-  for supplying or selling goods - for example, from retailing, wholesaling or manufacturing 
-  generated by an income-producing asset - for example, from operating a bulldozer 
-  for granting a right to use property - for example, the copyright to a computer program, or
-  generated by a business structure - for example, a large accounting firm. If the  trust receives an individual's PSI other than in the course of conducting a personal services business and does not promptly pay it to the individual as salary or wages:
-  the net amount of PSI is attributed to the individual and is not assessable to the trust, and
- certain related expenses are not deductible under the special rules.
Expenses specifically denied include rent, mortgage interest, rates and land tax for the residence of individuals (or their associates, such as a spouse) whose efforts or skills mainly generate the PSI for the  trust, the costs of a second private use car, and payments of salary or wages and superannuation for associates to the extent such payments relate to non-principal work. The denied expenses also include the total amount of the deductions allowed to the individual for a net personal services income loss. This is a mandatory field.</link:label>

This is allowed provided no beneficiary has received any amount referable to the gain during the income year or within two months of the end of the income year. The choice must be made in respect of the whole capital gain. Note post 2011 income year franked distributions and specific entitlements to these are generally dealt with under section 115-227 and are calculated in accordance with a particular formula.</link:label>
