- would be specifically not deductible under the income tax laws if the expenditure was not capital expenditure
- is specifically not deductible under the income tax laws for a reason other than that the expenditure is capital expenditure
- is of a private or domestic nature
- is incurred in relation to gaining or producing exempt income or non-assessable non-exempt income
- is excluded from the cost or cost base of an asset because, under special rules in the UCA or capital gains tax regimes respectively, the cost or cost base of the asset was taken to be the market value, or
- is a return of or on capital (for example, distributions by trustees) or a return of a non-assessable amount (for example, repayments of loan principal).

Special rules called the aggregation rules will determine who the partnership is connected or affiliated with. These rules prevent larger businesses from structuring or restructuring their affairs to take advantage of the small business entity concessions. An entity that is connected with the partnership, or that is its affiliate is referred to as a relevant entity. When calculating the aggregated turnover of the partnership, do not include income from:
- dealings between the partnership and a relevant entity
- dealings between any relevant entities of the partnership, and

Otherwise set the field to FALSE.  If TRUE, complete a PSI schedule. Personal services income (PSI) is income that is mainly a reward for an individualâ€™s personal efforts or skills (or would mainly be such a reward if it was derived by the individual).  A partnership may derive income which includes the PSI of one or more individuals. Examples of PSI include:
- income for the services of a professional practitioner in a sole practice
- income derived under a contract which is wholly or principally for the labour or services of an individual
- income for the exercise of professional skills by a professional sportsperson or entertainer
- income for the exercise of personal expertise by a consultant.
PSI does not include income that is mainly:
-  for supplying or selling goods â€“ for example, from retailing, wholesaling or manufacturing 
-  generated by an income-producing asset â€“ for example, from operating a bulldozer 
-  for granting a right to use property â€“ for example, the copyright to a computer program, or
-  generated by a business structure â€“ for example, a large accounting firm. If the partnership receives an individualâ€™s PSI other than in the course of conducting a personal services business and does not promptly pay it to the individual as salary or wages:
-  the net amount of PSI is attributed to the individual and is not assessable to the partnership, and
- certain related expenses are not deductible under the special rules.
Expenses specifically denied include rent, mortgage interest, rates and land tax for the residence of individuals (or their associates, such as a spouse) whose efforts or skills mainly generate the PSI for the partnership, the costs of a second private use car, and payments of salary or wages and superannuation for associates to the extent such payments relate to non-principal work. The denied expenses also include the total amount of the deductions allowed to the individual for a net personal services income loss. This is a mandatory field.</link:label>
