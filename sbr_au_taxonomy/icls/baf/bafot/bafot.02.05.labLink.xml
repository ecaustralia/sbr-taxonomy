Derivatives are generally defined as those instruments/contracts, where the value is based on other products, and/or on prices associated with financial products. Derivative contracts involve:
- Future delivery, receipt or exchange of financial items such as cash or another derivative instrument; or
- Future exchange of real assets for financial items where the contract may be tradeable and has a market value.
The contracts can either be binding on both parties (e.g. as with a currency swap) or subject to the exercise by one party of a right contained within the contract (as with options).

An exposure represents a claim or commitment of an entity, recorded both on and off the balance sheet and which can be the following in nature:
(a) Credit exposures (i.e. such as a money market placement with a Bank or holding of a corporation's debt securities);
(b) Asset exposures that are not in the nature of a credit exposure (e.g. a direct property investment); and
(c) Exposures in the nature of a liability or obligation to a single party or group of related parties.
An off-balance sheet exposure refers to an item that is not recognised in the statement of financial position, such as contingent assets and liabilities.

Net market value, or fair value, is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.</link:label>

The value of admissible assets with non-standard resilience factors is the net market value, or fair value, of assets where the actuary has considered that non-standard resilience factors are appropriate.

This should only be used in rare cases. It is intended to cover situations where assets are disaggregated into (1) an identifiable sub-asset and (2) a residual that does not fit into any of the asset sectors specified by Life Insurance Prudential Standards for resilience purposes, or where a non-standard resilience risk has been modelled in accordance with Life Insurance Prudential Standards.

Net market value, or fair value, is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.</link:label>

The value of admissible assets with non-standard resilience factors is the net market value, or fair value, of assets where the actuary has considered that non-standard resilience factors are appropriate.

This should only be used in rare cases. It is intended to cover situations where assets are disaggregated into (1) an identifiable sub-asset and (2) a residual that does not fit into any of the asset sectors specified by Life Insurance Prudential Standards for resilience purposes, or where a non-standard resilience risk has been modelled in accordance with Life Insurance Prudential Standards.

Adjusted value of admissible assets is the value of total admissible assets with resilience requirement adjusted for:
- Credit Risk Yield Changes;
- Prescribed Yield Changes (allowing for diversification factor);
- Adverse Exchange Movement factor; and
- Credit Risk Default factors
as determined in accordance with the capital adequacy standards.

Total admissible assets is the value of total assets as determined in accordance with the accounting standards less the value of those deemed to be inadmissible, as per the capital adequacy capital requirement standards.

Eligible Capital is:
the Net Assets of the reporting party as determined in accordance with accounting standards, adjusted for:

1) Policy Owner Retained Profits as determined in accordance with accounting standards;
2) Eligible Amount of Approved Subordinated Debt as determined in accordance with the approval letter received from the relevant regulatory authority;
3) Net market value, or fair value, of borrowings classified as seed capital (see below); and
4) MTV Adjustment.

Where:

3) Seed capital is the preliminary contribution of funding toward the financing of a new business. Commonly this is in the form of a loan, usually provided by a related entity. Borrowings are amounts of money on loan from financial institutions or other creditors with the promise or understanding that it will be repaid. 
Net market value, or fair value, is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.

4) The MTV Adjustment is the value of the Net Policy Liabilities (net of reinsurance) less the Minimum Termination Value (MTV) net of reinsurance excluding the amount of any investment linked risk margin. Net Policy Liabilities are valued in accordance with prudential standards LPS 1.04, Valuation of Policy Liabilities, offset by the value of policy liabilities ceded under reinsurance. This amount includes liabilities for deferred fee revenue and deferred acquisition costs. For participating benefits, it includes bonuses in respect of the relevant period. This method of disclosure differs from the Australian Accounting Standards. The investment linked (IL) risk margin reflects the additional risks that may be borne by the reporting party in conducting investment-linked business.

The minimum termination value (MTV) is determined by the prudential standards as the amount that a life insurer is obliged to pay to policyholders if they decided to voluntarily terminate their policies at the relevant date. The obligation might be contractual, statutory or a result of past practice. Calculated as the greater of: 
a) the lowest Termination Value that the reporting party is obliged to pay; and 
b) the amount calculated in accordance with the Surrender Value Standard.


Required Capital is:
the amount of required capital determined in accordance with the capital adequacy standard, being the difference between the net capital adequacy requirement and the adjusted liabilities.

The net capital adequacy requirement is the Total Capital Adequacy Requirement less Gross Policy Liabilities ceded under reinsurance. Total Capital Adequacy Requirement is the amount required under the capital adequacy standard to ensure, as far as practicable, that, at any time, the financial position of each business unit of a reporting party is such that the reporting party will be able, out of the assets of the unit, to meet all policy and other liabilities referable to the unit at that time as they become due. Gross Policy Liabilities ceded under reinsurance are determined in accordance with the accounting standards.

The adjusted liabilities are the total of the Minimum Termination Value (net of reinsurance and excluding the Investment Linked [IL] risk margin) and "Other Liabilities" (the total liabilities as determined in accordance with the relevant accounting standards other than Policy Liabilities, Approved Eligible Subordinated Debt and Seed Capital).</link:label>

Non-indexed securities pay an income stream that is not dependent upon any external factor.

The Credit Risk Yield Adjustment is an addition to the resilience reserves made in accordance with the capital adequacy standards. The Resilience Reserve is determined as the additional amount that needs to be held before the happening of a prescribed set of changes in the economic environment ( as per the capital adequacy standard), such that after the changes the admissible assets of the reporting party are able to meet the policy owner and other liabilities of the statutory fund, in an ongoing business context.

Admissible interest bearing securities is the value of all debt securities paying an income stream based upon an interest rate consistent with the classification and measurement basis used for investment securities in accordance with the accounting standards, less the value of those deemed to be inadmissible, as per the capital adequacy standard. 

The inadmissible assets are: 
a) defined benefit superannuation fund surpluses;
b) holdings in an associated or subsidiary entity which is a Financial Services entity;
c) non-realisable (in the context of the capital adequacy tests) intangible assets;
d) assets with too little diversification, are too illiquid or have too great an exposure to one obligor of low credit standing;
e) reinsurance assets which may not be fully recoverable in the context of the capital adequacy tests; and
f) amounts by which the recorded value of an asset exceeds its net realisable value.</link:label>

Admissible other non-investment assets is the value of the total assets acquired without the intent to derive a gain either through an income stream or disposal, other than those categorised elsewhere, less the value of those deemed to be inadmissible, as per the capital adequacy standard.

The capital adequacy requirement is the amount required under the capital adequacy standard to ensure, as far as practicable, that, at any time, the financial position of each capital adequacy unit of a reporting party is such that the reporting party will be able, out of the assets of the unit, to meet all policy and other liabilities referable to the unit at that time as they become due.

The "Basic" capital adequacy amount is calculated as the total of:

1)  Liabilities prior to prescribed change
2) Inadmissible Assets; and
3) Capital Adequacy Resilience Reserve including any adjustment recognising the potential release of resilience reserves from other statutory funds in accordance with the relevant capital requirements standard.

where:
Liabilities prior to prescribed change are the total liabilities as determined in accordance with the capital adequacy prudential standard, prior to any prescribed changes to assumptions in that standard used to calculate them.

Inadmissible assets are: 
a) defined benefit superannuation fund surpluses;
b) holdings in an associated or subsidiary entity which is a Financial Services entity;
c) non-realisable (in the context of the capital adequacy tests) intangible assets;
d) assets with too little diversification, are too illiquid or have too great an exposure to one obligor of low credit standing;
e) reinsurance assets which may not be fully recoverable in the context of the capital adequacy tests; and
f) amounts by which the recorded value of an asset exceeds its net realisable value.

The Capital Adequacy Resilience Reserve is determined as the additional amount that needs to be held before the happening of a prescribed set of changes in the economic environment ( as per the capital adequacy standard), such that after the changes the admissible assets of the reporting party are able to meet the policy owner and other liabilities of the statutory fund. There is no resilience requirement where the policy owner liabilities of the statutory fund move in harmony with the assets supporting them.</link:label>

The Prescribed Yield Adjustment is an addition to the resilience reserves calculated using prescribed factors, after allowing for the beneficial implications for asset risks of diversification across asset sectors, as set out in the capital adequacy standards. The Resilience Reserve is determined as the additional amount that needs to be held before the happening of a prescribed set of changes in the economic environment ( as per the capital adequacy standard), such that after the changes the admissible assets of the reporting party are able to meet the policy owner and other liabilities of the statutory fund, in an ongoing business context.

Admissible assets with non-standard resilience factors are those assets where the actuary has considered that non-standard resilience factors are appropriate. This should only be used in rare cases. It is intended to cover situations where assets are disaggregated into (1) an identifiable sub-asset and (2) a residual that does not fit into any of the asset sectors specified by Life Insurance Prudential Standards for resilience purposes, or where a non-standard resilience risk has been modelled in accordance with Life Insurance Prudential Standards.</link:label>

The net capital adequacy requirement is the Total Capital Adequacy Requirement less Gross Policy Liabilities ceded under reinsurance.

Total capital adequacy Requirement is the amount required under the capital adequacy standard to ensure, as far as practicable, that, at any time, the financial position of each business unit of a reporting party is such that the reporting party will be able, out of the assets of the unit, to meet all policy and other liabilities referable to the unit at that time as they become due.

Gross Policy Liabilities ceded under reinsurance are determined in accordance with the accounting standards.

The adjusted liabilities are the total of the Minimum Termination Value (net of reinsurance and excluding the Investment Linked [IL] risk margin) and "Other Liabilities" (see below).

The minimum termination value (MTV) is determined by the prudential standards as the amount that a life insurer is obliged to pay to policyholders if they decided to voluntarily terminate their policies at the relevant date. The obligation might be contractual, statutory or a result of past practice. Calculated as the greater of: 
a) the lowest Termination Value that the reporting party is obliged to pay; and 
b) the amount calculated in accordance with the Surrender Value Standard.

The investment linked (IL) risk margin reflects the additional risks that may be borne by the reporting party in conducting investment-linked business.

Other Liabilities are the total liabilities as determined in accordance with the relevant accounting standards other than Policy Liabilities, Approved Eligible Subordinated Debt and Seed Capital.

The Capital Adequacy Reserve Ratio should be calculated as:
SR / Absolute(MTV + OL)
where:
SR = the amount reserved, including the amount of any investment linked risk margin (see below), in accordance with the capital adequacy standard

MTV = the minimum termination value (net of reinsurance) excluding the amount of any investment linked risk margin (see below)

OL = Other Liabilities - the total liabilities as determined in accordance with the relevant accounting standards other than Policy Liabilities, Borrowings, Approved Eligible Subordinated Debt and Seed Capital.

The minimum termination value (MTV) is determined by the prudential standards as the amount that a life insurer is obliged to pay to policyholders if they decided to voluntarily terminate their policies at the relevant date. The obligation might be contractual, statutory or a result of past practice. Calculated as the greater of: 
a) the lowest Termination Value that the reporting party is obliged to pay; and 
b) the amount calculated in accordance with the Surrender Value Standard.

The investment linked (IL) risk margin reflects the additional risks that may be borne by the reporting party in conducting investment-linked business.</link:label>

The admissible value of property investments is the net market value of the entity's General Fund holdings of property investments as determined in accordance with the relevant accounting standards, including accrued income, less the value of those deemed to be inadmissible, as per the management capital prudential standard. This  includes investments in property by way of units in property trusts or other indirect investment methods as well as investments in real property (land and buildings). 

The inadmissible assets are: 
a) assets which have a value that is dependent upon the continuation of the business;

b) holdings in an associated or subsidiary entity which is a Financial Services entity;
c) non-realisable (in the context of the scenarios of adverse experience) intangible assets;
d) other assets not measured at fair value in the regulatory financial statements; and
e) the alignment necessary to ensure the remaining assets and the other liabilities are based on net market value.

General Fund refers to the management fund for a friendly society or the shareholders' fund for other life companies, and is distinct and separate from the statutory funds of the life company.

Net market value, or fair value, is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.</link:label>

Balance of Resilience Reserve (RRB) is expected to be calculated as:
 RRB    = RR  -  RRCR

Where:
RR    =  Resilience Reserve  =  L' x [A / A"] - L;

RRCR    = (L' / A") x (DELTA ACRY + DELTA ACRD)

A      =  Assets prior to prescribed change; 

L       =  Liabilities prior to prescribed change.

L'    =  Liabilities adjusted for the prescribed yield change in the discount rate used in their valuation, in accordance with the management capital prudential standard.

A"    =  Adjusted value of admissible assets (see below); 

DELTA ACRY       =  Credit Risk Yield Adjustment - an addition to the resilience reserves (see below) made in accordance with the management capital prudential standards; and

DELTA ACRD       =  Credit Risk Default Adjustment - an addition to the resilience reserves (see below) calculated using the prescribed Credit Risk Default factors as set out in the management capital prudential standards.

Adjusted value of admissible assets is the value of total admissible assets with resilience requirement adjusted for:
- Credit Risk Yield Changes;
- Prescribed Yield Changes (allowing for diversification factor);
- Adverse Exchange Movement factor; and
- Credit Risk Default factors
as determined in accordance with the management capital prudential standards.

Total admissible assets is the value of total assets as determined in accordance with the accounting standards less the value of those deemed to be inadmissible, as per the management capital prudential standards. 

The inadmissible assets are: 
1) assets, the value of which is dependent on the ongoing conduct of business; 
2) the amount by which holdings in associated financial services entities (as defined in the prudential standards) exceeds their net tangible assets; and 
3) concentrated or illiquid asset exposures.

The Resilience Reserve is determined as the additional amount that needs to be held before the happening of a prescribed set of changes in the economic environment, such that after the changes the admissible assets of the reporting party are able to meet the policy owner and other liabilities of the statutory fund. There is no resilience requirement where the policy owner liabilities of the statutory fund move in harmony with the assets supporting them.</link:label>

The admissible value of tax assets is the value as determined in accordance with the accounting standards less the value of those deemed to be inadmissible, as per the management capital prudential standard. 

The inadmissible assets are: 
a) assets which have a value that is dependent upon the continuation of the business;
b) holdings in an associated or subsidiary entity which is a Financial Services entity;
c) non-realisable (in the context of the scenarios of adverse experience) intangible assets;
d) other assets not measured at fair value in the regulatory financial statements; and
e) the alignment necessary to ensure the remaining assets and the other liabilities are based on net market value.

General Fund refers to the management fund for a friendly society or the shareholders' fund for other life companies, and is distinct and separate from the statutory funds of the life company.</link:label>

Non-indexed securities pay an income stream that is not dependent upon any external factor.

The Credit Risk Yield Adjustment is an addition to the resilience reserves made in accordance with the management capital prudential standard. The Resilience Reserve is determined as the additional amount that needs to be held before the happening of a prescribed set of changes in the economic environment ( as per the management capital prudential standard), such that after the changes the admissible assets of the General Fund are able to meet the liabilities of the General Fund, in an ongoing business context.

The admissible value of interest bearing securities is the net market value of all debt securities paying an income stream based upon an interest rate consistent with the classification and measurement basis used for investment securities in accordance with the accounting standards, including accrued income, less the value of those deemed to be inadmissible, as per the management capital prudential standard.

The inadmissible assets are: 
a) assets which have a value that is dependent upon the continuation of the business;
b) holdings in an associated or subsidiary entity which is a Financial Services entity;
c) non-realisable (in the context of the scenarios of adverse experience) intangible assets;

Non-indexed securities pay an income stream that is not dependent upon any external factor.

The Adverse Exchange Movement Adjustment is an addition to the resilience reserves calculated using the prescribed Adverse Exchange Movement factor as set out in the management capital prudential standard. The Resilience Reserve is determined as the additional amount that needs to be held before the happening of a prescribed set of changes in the economic environment ( as per the management capital prudential standard), such that after the changes the admissible assets of the General Fund are able to meet the liabilities of the General Fund, in an ongoing business context.

The admissible value of interest bearing securities is the net market value of all debt securities paying an income stream based upon an interest rate consistent with the classification and measurement basis used for investment securities in accordance with the accounting standards, including accrued income, less the value of those deemed to be inadmissible, as per the management capital prudential standard.

The inadmissible assets are: 
a) assets which have a value that is dependent upon the continuation of the business;
b) holdings in an associated or subsidiary entity which is a Financial Services entity;
c) non-realisable (in the context of the scenarios of adverse experience) intangible assets;
d) other assets not measured at fair value in the regulatory financial statements; and
e) the alignment necessary to ensure the remaining assets and the other liabilities are based on net market value.

This should only be used in rare cases. It is intended to cover situations where assets are disaggregated into (1) an identifiable sub-asset and (2) a residual that does not fit into any of the asset sectors specified by Life Insurance Prudential Standards for resilience purposes, or where a non-standard resilience risk has been modelled in accordance with Life Insurance Prudential Standards.

The Prescribed Yield Adjustment is an addition to the resilience reserves calculated using prescribed factors, after allowing for the beneficial implications for asset risks of diversification across asset sectors, as set out in the management capital prudential standard. The Resilience Reserve is determined as the additional amount that needs to be held before the happening of a prescribed set of changes in the economic environment ( as per the management capital prudential standard), such that after the changes the admissible assets of the General Fund are able to meet the liabilities of the General Fund, in an ongoing business context.

The admissible value is the net market value of all assets where the actuary has considered that non-standard resilience factors are appropriate, less the value of those deemed to be inadmissible, as per the management capital prudential standard. 

The inadmissible assets are: 
a) assets which have a value that is dependent upon the continuation of the business;
b) holdings in an associated or subsidiary entity which is a Financial Services entity;
c) non-realisable (in the context of the scenarios of adverse experience) intangible assets;
d) other assets not measured at fair value in the regulatory financial statements; and
e) the alignment necessary to ensure the remaining assets and the other liabilities are based on net market value.

General Fund refers to the management fund for a friendly society or the shareholders' fund for other life companies, and is distinct and separate from the statutory funds of the life company.

Net market value, or fair value, is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.</link:label>

3) Net market value, or fair value, of borrowings classified as seed capital (see below); and

4) MTV Adjustment.

Where:

Adjustment 3) Seed capital is the preliminary contribution of funding toward the financing of a new business. Commonly this is in the form of a loan, usually provided by a related entity. Borrowings are amounts of money on loan from financial institutions or other creditors with the promise or understanding that it will be repaid regardless of how the business turns out, whereas Seed Capital is more like Subordinated Debt and doesn't have to be repaid in extreme adverse circumstances.
 
Net market value, or fair value, is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.

Adjustment 4) The MTV Adjustment is the value of the Net Policy Liabilities (net of reinsurance) less the Net Minimum Termination Value (MTV).

Net Policy Liabilities are valued in accordance with prudential standards LPS 1.04, Valuation of Policy Liabilities, offset by the value of policy liabilities ceded under reinsurance. This amount includes liabilities for deferred fee revenue and deferred acquisition costs. For participating benefits, it includes bonuses in respect of the relevant period. This method of disclosure differs from the Australian Accounting Standards.

Net Minimum Termination Value (MTV) is the minimum termination value (net of reinsurance) excluding the amount of any investment linked risk margin.

The minimum termination value (MTV) is determined by the prudential standards as the amount that a life insurer is obliged to pay to policyholders if they decided to voluntarily terminate their policies at the relevant date. The obligation might be contractual, statutory or a result of past practice. Calculated as the greater of: 
a) the lowest Termination Value that the reporting party is obliged to pay; and 
b) the amount calculated in accordance with the Surrender Value Standard.

The investment linked (IL) risk margin reflecst the additional risks that may be borne by the reporting party in conducting investment-linked business.</link:label>

The net solvency requirement is the Total Solvency Requirement less Gross Policy Liabilities ceded under reinsurance.

Total Solvency Requirement is the amount required under the solvency standard to ensure, as far as practicable, that, at any time, the financial position of each business unit of a reporting party is such that the reporting party will be able, out of the assets of the unit, to meet all policy and other liabilities referable to the unit at that time as they become due.

Gross Policy Liabilities ceded under reinsurance are determined in accordance with the accounting standards.

The adjusted liabilities are the total of the Minimum Termination Value (net of reinsurance and excluding the Investment Linked [IL] risk margin) and "Other Liabilities" (see below).

The minimum termination value (MTV) is determined by the prudential standards as the amount that a life insurer is obliged to pay to policyholders if they decided to voluntarily terminate their policies at the relevant date. The obligation might be contractual, statutory or a result of past practice. Calculated as the greater of: 
a) the lowest Termination Value that the reporting party is obliged to pay; and 
b) the amount calculated in accordance with the Surrender Value Standard.

The investment linked (IL) risk margin reflects the additional risks that may be borne by the reporting party in conducting investment-linked business.

Other Liabilities are the total liabilities as determined in accordance with the relevant accounting standards other than Policy Liabilities, Approved Eligible Subordinated Debt and Seed Capital.

Eligible approved subordinated debt, is determined in accordance with the approval letter received from the relevant regulatory authority.

Seed capital is the preliminary contribution of funding toward the financing of a new business. Commonly this is in the form of a loan, usually provided by a related entity.</link:label>

Balance of Resilience Reserve (RRB) is expected to be calculated as:
 RRB    = RR  -  RRCR

Where:
RR    =  Resilience Reserve  =  L' x [A / A"] - L;

RRCR    = (L' / A") x (ACRY + ACRD)

A      =  Assets prior to prescribed change; 

L       =  Liabilities prior to prescribed change.

L'    =  Liabilities adjusted for the prescribed yield change in the discount rate used in their valuation, in accordance with the solvency standard.

A"    =  Adjusted value of admissible assets (see below); 

ACRY       =  value of the Credit Risk Yield Adjustment - an addition to the resilience reserves (see below) made in accordance with the solvency standards; and

ACRD       =  value of the Credit Risk Default Adjustment - an addition to the resilience reserves (see below) calculated using the prescribed Credit Risk Default factors as set out in the solvency standards.

Adjusted value of admissible assets is the value of total admissible assets with resilience requirement adjusted for:
- Credit Risk Yield Changes;
- Prescribed Yield Changes (allowing for diversification factor);
- Adverse Exchange Movement factor; and
- Credit Risk Default factors
as determined in accordance with the solvency standards.

Total admissible assets is the value of total assets as determined in accordance with the accounting standards less the value of those deemed to be inadmissible, as per the solvency standards. 

The inadmissible assets are: 
1) assets, the value of which is dependent on the ongoing conduct of business; 
2) the amount by which holdings in associated financial services entities (as defined in the prudential standards) exceeds their net tangible assets; and 
3) concentrated or illiquid asset exposures.

The Resilience Reserve is determined as the additional amount that needs to be held before the happening of a prescribed set of changes in the economic environment, such that after the changes the admissible assets of the reporting party are able to meet the policy owner and other liabilities of the statutory fund. There is no resilience requirement where the policy owner liabilities of the statutory fund move in harmony with the assets supporting them.</link:label>

This is the total liabilities for capital requirements purposes excluding other liabilities and is calculated as the greater of: 
a) the Current Termination Value of insurance policies as at the relevant date, as calculated by the solvency standard, adjusted for the effective amount of risk mitigation difference to be included as an offset or addition to this value; and
b) the greater of the Policy Liability value (as determined in accordance with the assumptions of the solvency standard) or the Minimum Termination Value (MTV) plus the value of the Expense Reserve. 

The Current Termination Value of a policy is either:
a) the amount that would be paid on the basis used in practice from time to time in the event of voluntary termination; or
b) where no amount would be paid, the discounted present value of the unexpired risks, future payments and/or contractual premium refunds.

Risk mitigation difference is the difference in the value of risk mitigation arrangements as per prudential standards (reinsurance and other similar risk mitigating arrangements and contracts, that while not legally reinsurance, have similar effects) and the value as reflected in the financial statements. 

MTV is the amount that a life insurer is obliged to pay to policyholders if they decided to voluntarily terminate their policies at the relevant date. The obligation might be contractual, statutory or a result of past practice. Calculated as the greater of: 
a) the lowest Termination Value that the reporting party is obliged to pay; and 
b) the amount calculated in accordance with the Surrender Value Standard.

The Expense Reserve is the component of the determination of the requirement under the solvency standard that reflects capital requirements arising from expense risks in a closed fund scenario.</link:label>

Eligible Capital is:
the Net Assets of the reporting party as determined in accordance with accounting standards, including accrued income, adjusted for:

1) Policy Owner Retained Profits as determined in accordance with accounting standards;
2) Eligible Amount of Approved Subordinated Debt as determined in accordance with the approval letter received from the relevant regulatory authority;
3) Net market value, or fair value, of borrowings classified as seed capital (see below); and
4) MTV Adjustment.

Where:

3) Seed capital is the preliminary contribution of funding toward the financing of a new business. Commonly this is in the form of a loan, usually provided by a related entity. Borrowings are amounts of money on loan from financial institutions or other creditors with the promise or understanding that it will be repaid. 
Net market value, or fair value, is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.

4) The MTV Adjustment is the value of the Net Policy Liabilities (net of reinsurance) less the Minimum Termination Value (MTV) net of reinsurance excluding the amount of any investment linked risk margin. Net Policy Liabilities are valued in accordance with prudential standards LPS 1.04, Valuation of Policy Liabilities, offset by the value of policy liabilities ceded under reinsurance. This amount includes liabilities for deferred fee revenue and deferred acquisition costs. For participating benefits, it includes bonuses in respect of the relevant period. This method of disclosure differs from the Australian Accounting Standards. The investment linked (IL) risk margin reflects the additional risks that may be borne by the reporting party in conducting investment-linked business.

The minimum termination value (MTV) is determined by the prudential standards as the amount that a life insurer is obliged to pay to policyholders if they decided to voluntarily terminate their policies at the relevant date. The obligation might be contractual, statutory or a result of past practice. Calculated as the greater of: 
a) the lowest Termination Value that the reporting party is obliged to pay; and 
b) the amount calculated in accordance with the Surrender Value Standard.


Required Capital is:
the amount of required capital determined in accordance with the solvency standard, being the difference between the net solvency requirement and the adjusted liabilities.

The net solvency requirement is the Total Solvency Requirement less Gross Policy Liabilities ceded under reinsurance. Total Solvency Requirement is the amount required under the solvency standard to ensure, as far as practicable, that, at any time, the financial position of each business unit of a reporting party is such that the reporting party will be able, out of the assets of the unit, to meet all policy and other liabilities referable to the unit at that time as they become due. Gross Policy Liabilities ceded under reinsurance are determined in accordance with the accounting standards.

The adjusted liabilities are the total of the Minimum Termination Value (net of reinsurance and excluding the Investment Linked [IL] risk margin) and "Other Liabilities" (the total liabilities as determined in accordance with the relevant accounting standards other than Policy Liabilities, Approved Eligible Subordinated Debt and Seed Capital).</link:label>

The Credit Risk Default Adjustment is an addition to the resilience reserves calculated using the prescribed Credit Risk Default factors as set out in the solvency standards. The Resilience Reserve is determined as the additional amount that needs to be held before the happening of a prescribed set of changes in the economic environment, such that after the changes the admissible assets of the reporting party are able to meet the policy owner and other liabilities of the statutory fund.

Admissible assets with non-standard resilience factors is the net market value, or fair value, of assets where the actuary has considered that non-standard resilience factors are appropriate.

This should only be used in rare cases. It is intended to cover situations where assets are disaggregated into (1) an identifiable sub-asset and (2) a residual that does not fit into any of the asset sectors specified by Life Insurance Prudential Standards for resilience purposes, or where a non-standard resilience risk has been modelled in accordance with Life Insurance Prudential Standards.

Net market value, or fair value, is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.</link:label>

Equity investment securities are, as defined by the Australian Accounting Standards, contracts that evidence a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all its liabilities, acquired with the intent to derive a gain either through an income stream or disposal.

The inadmissible assets are: 
a) holdings in an associated or subsidiary entity which is a Financial Services entity;
b) assets with too little diversification, are too illiquid or have too great an exposure to one obligor of low credit standing; and

The "Basic Capital Requirements Liabilities" is the total liabilities for capital requirements purposes excluding other liabilities and is calculated as the greater of: 
a) the Current Termination Value of insurance policies as at the relevant date, as calculated by the solvency standard, adjusted for the effective amount of risk mitigation difference to be included as an offset or addition to this value; and
b) the greater of the Policy Liability value (as determined in accordance with the assumptions of the solvency standard) or the Minimum Termination Value (MTV) plus the value of the Expense Reserve. 

The Current Termination Value of a policy is either:
a) the amount that would be paid on the basis used in practice from time to time in the event of voluntary termination; or
b) where no amount would be paid, the discounted present value of the unexpired risks, future payments and/or contractual premium refunds.

Risk mitigation difference is the difference in the value of risk mitigation arrangements as per prudential standards (reinsurance and other similar risk mitigating arrangements and contracts, that while not legally reinsurance, have similar effects) and the value as reflected in the financial statements. 

MTV is the amount that a life insurer is obliged to pay to policyholders if they decided to voluntarily terminate their policies at the relevant date. The obligation might be contractual, statutory or a result of past practice. Calculated as the greater of: 
a) the lowest Termination Value that the reporting party is obliged to pay; and 
b) the amount calculated in accordance with the Surrender Value Standard.

The Expense Reserve is the component of the determination of the requirement under the solvency standard that reflects capital requirements arising from expense risks in a closed fund scenario.</link:label>

The Prescribed Yield Adjustment is an addition to the resilience reserves calculated using prescribed factors, after allowing for the beneficial implications for asset risks of diversification across asset sectors, as set out in the solvency standards. The Resilience Reserve is determined as the additional amount that needs to be held before the happening of a prescribed set of changes in the economic environment, such that after the changes the admissible assets of the reporting party are able to meet the policy owner and other liabilities of the statutory fund.

Admissible assets with non-standard resilience factors is the net market value, or fair value, of assets where the actuary has considered that non-standard resilience factors are appropriate.

This should only be used in rare cases. It is intended to cover situations where assets are disaggregated into (1) an identifiable sub-asset and (2) a residual that does not fit into any of the asset sectors specified by Life Insurance Prudential Standards for resilience purposes, or where a non-standard resilience risk has been modelled in accordance with Life Insurance Prudential Standards.

Net market value, or fair value, is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.</link:label>

MTV = the minimum termination value (net of reinsurance) excluding the amount of any investment linked risk margin (see below)

OL = Other Liabilities - the total liabilities as determined in accordance with the relevant accounting standards, other than Policy Liabilities, Approved Eligible Subordinated Debt and Seed Capital.

The minimum termination value (MTV) is determined by the prudential standards as the amount that a life insurer is obliged to pay to policyholders if they decided to voluntarily terminate their policies at the relevant date. The obligation might be contractual, statutory or a result of past practice. Calculated as the greater of: 
a) the lowest Termination Value that the reporting party is obliged to pay; and 
b) the amount calculated in accordance with the Surrender Value Standard.
