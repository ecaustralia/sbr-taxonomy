- The definition excludes residential property loans for owner occupation and loans to individuals or families for investment in residential property.
- Exclude loans to private family companies and/or family trusts where the residence is occupied by the directors or principal beneficiaries of the family trust.
- Exclude loans to builders, construction companies or sub-contractors who are paid for the execution of their contracts by a third party and not out of the sale or rental of the property upon completion. If, however, they assume development risk, whether recognised as a developer or not, the exposure is classified as property exposure.
- Rural exposures will generally not meet the definition of commercial property, unless the property has been acquired specifically for lease or resale, and where the servicing of the debt is dependent on such lease or resale (and/or the lease or resale of other properties).
- Facilities to investment companies, property management companies and unit trusts whose success in business (and therefore the servicing and repayment of the debt) is predominantly dependent upon the performance of the property market are included in commercial property exposure.
- Facilities provided for the acquisition of property to be used for generating income other than through rental or sale are classified under the industry from which the cash flow servicing the debt is derived. In such owner-occupied properties where part of the debt servicing is derived from rental income, the classification depends on the predominant source of debt servicing. If most of the servicing is by way of income derived from the owner's business, the exposure is classified under that business. However, if most of the servicing derives from the property itself, it is a property exposure.

- The definition excludes residential property loans for owner occupation and loans to individuals or families for investment in residential property.
- Exclude loans to private family companies and/or family trusts where the residence is occupied by the directors or principal beneficiaries of the family trust.
- Exclude loans to builders, construction companies or sub-contractors who are paid for the execution of their contracts by a third party and not out of the sale or rental of the property upon completion. If, however, they assume development risk, whether recognised as a developer or not, the exposure is classified as property exposure.
- Rural exposures will generally not meet the definition of commercial property, unless the property has been acquired specifically for lease or resale, and where the servicing of the debt is dependent on such lease or resale (and/or the lease or resale of other properties).
- Facilities to investment companies, property management companies and unit trusts whose success in business (and therefore the servicing and repayment of the debt) is predominantly dependent upon the performance of the property market are included in commercial property exposure.
- Facilities provided for the acquisition of property to be used for generating income other than through rental or sale are classified under the industry from which the cash flow servicing the debt is derived. In such owner-occupied properties where part of the debt servicing is derived from rental income, the classification depends on the predominant source of debt servicing. If most of the servicing is by way of income derived from the owner's business, the exposure is classified under that business. However, if most of the servicing derives from the property itself, it is a property exposure.
- The Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC) codes may be used as a guide. Although ANZSIC was not developed for this purpose, property exposures will generally be to enterprises classified under ANZSIC 771 (Property Operators and Developers), and exclude those under subdivision 57 (Accommodation, Cafes and Restaurants). Also excluded are loans to enterprises classified under subdivision 41 (General Construction) unless they assume the development risk, as described above.</link:label>

- The definition excludes residential property loans for owner occupation and loans to individuals or families for investment in residential property.
- Exclude loans to private family companies and/or family trusts where the residence is occupied by the directors or principal beneficiaries of the family trust.
- Exclude loans to builders, construction companies or sub-contractors who are paid for the execution of their contracts by a third party and not out of the sale or rental of the property upon completion. If, however, they assume development risk, whether recognised as a developer or not, the exposure is classified as property exposure.
- Rural exposures will generally not meet the definition of commercial property, unless the property has been acquired specifically for lease or resale, and where the servicing of the debt is dependent on such lease or resale (and/or the lease or resale of other properties).
- Facilities to investment companies, property management companies and unit trusts whose success in business (and therefore the servicing and repayment of the debt) is predominantly dependent upon the performance of the property market are included in commercial property exposure.
- Facilities provided for the acquisition of property to be used for generating income other than through rental or sale are classified under the industry from which the cash flow servicing the debt is derived. In such owner-occupied properties where part of the debt servicing is derived from rental income, the classification depends on the predominant source of debt servicing. If most of the servicing is by way of income derived from the owner's business, the exposure is classified under that business. However, if most of the servicing derives from the property itself, it is a property exposure.
