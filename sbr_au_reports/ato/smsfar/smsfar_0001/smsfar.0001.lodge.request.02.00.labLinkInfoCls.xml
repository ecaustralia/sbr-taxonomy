- the employer was required by section 299C of the SISA to inform the fund of the individualâ€™s TFN by the end of the past year, but did not provide the TFN to the fund,
- as a result, the contributions made in respect of that member were no-TFN-quoted contributions in that past year,
- an amount of additional tax (which is the interest-bearing tax) that was payable in respect of the no-TFN-quoted contributions counts towards the no-TFN tax offset under Subdivision 295-J of the ITAA 1997 for an income year (the current year) for the fund,
- the no-TFN tax offset under that subdivision is applied when assessing the fund for the current year.
The interest is payable on each amount of interest-bearing tax. Interest on tax that counts towards the no-TFN tax offset is calculated for the period between the later of:
- the day on which the amount of interest-bearing tax was paid, or
- the day by which the amount of interest-bearing tax was required to be paid, and
- the date on which the fund lodges its tax return for the current year (which is deemed to be the date on which the current year assessment is made). The date of payment of the interest-bearing tax is either:
- the date shown on the receipt; or
- the date payment is mailed to us plus three business days.
If the relevant interest period extends over two or more quarters, calculate the interest for the number of days in each quarter. The rate of interest payable on the interest-bearing tax is the base interest rate determined under section 8AAD of the TAA 1953.</link:label>
