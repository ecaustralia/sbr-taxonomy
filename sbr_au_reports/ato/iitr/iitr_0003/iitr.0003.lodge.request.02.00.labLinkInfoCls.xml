To qualify for the tax offset, the individual taxpayer's usual residence must be situated have in a remote area (not necessarily continuously) for:
 - 183 days or more during the applicable reporting period, or
 - 183 days or more during the period one year prior to the applicable reporting period (including at least one day in the current applicable reporting period) and did not claim a zone tax offset in their previous tax return.

The Individual taxpayer is eligible for an overseas forces tax offset if they served in a specified overseas locality as a member of the Australian Defence Force or a United Nations armed force in the applicable reporting period and income relating to that service was not specifically exempt from tax.

Overseas Offset
You may be eligible for an overseas forces tax offset if you served in a specified overseas locality as a member of the Australian Defence Force or a United Nations armed force during the applicable reporting period and income relating to that service was not specifically exempt from tax. Periods of service for which your income was â€˜exempt foreign employment incomeâ€™ are excluded in working out your eligibility for the tax offset.

Your employer will be able to advise you whether you served in a locality that qualifies for the overseas forces tax offset.

To claim the full tax offset, you must have served in the overseas locality for 183 days or more during the applicable reporting period. If your overseas service was less than 183 days, you may be able to claim part of the tax offset. Unlike the zone tax offset, you cannot carry forward any unused days from previous years to make up 183 days.

If you served in an overseas locality for less than 183 days, but the total number of days served in the overseas locality, when added to the number of days served in one or more zones, is 183 days or more, you may still be entitled to claim the full overseas forces tax offset. If you served as a member of the Australian Defence Force, days spent in a zone must be defence force service.

If you qualify for both an overseas forces tax offset and a zone tax offset, you can claim only one of them. Claim the higher one.

If you did not receive this offset in your 2012â€“13 income tax assessment you can only claim net medical expenses relating to disability aids, attendant care or aged care.

Disability aids are items of property manufactured as, or generally recognised to be, an aid to the functional capacity of a person with a disability but, generally, will not include ordinary household or commercial appliances.

Attendant care expenses relate to services and care provided to a person with a disability to assist with everyday living, such as the provision of personal assistance, home nursing, home maintenance, and domestic services.
Aged care expenses relate to services and accommodation provided by an approved aged care provider to a person who is a care recipient or continuing care recipient within the meaning of the Aged Care Act 1997.

Net medical expenses are your total medical expenses less refunds from Medicare and private health insurers which you, or someone else, received or are entitled to receive. They do not include contributions to a private health insurer, travel or accommodation expenses associated with medical treatment, or inoculations for overseas travel.

This tax offset is income tested. The percentage of net medical expenses you can claim is determined by your adjusted taxable income (ATI) and family status.</link:label>

 Separate the amount of "Total tax losses from earlier years" into "losses from primary production" and "losses from non-primary production" then calculate "Net exempt income for this year" by subtracting "expenses relating to exempt income" from "exempt income of current financial year" to determine the â€œtotal prior year losses available for use this yearâ€�.
