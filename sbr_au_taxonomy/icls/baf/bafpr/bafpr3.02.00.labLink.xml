		<link:label xlink:label="lbl_DE2294" xlink:role="http://sbr.gov.au/fdtn/sbr.01.02.tech/dataElementGuidance" xlink:type="resource" xml:lang="en">For prospective accounting reporting recognise outwards reinsurance costs fully upfront as an expense, relating to cover that will be applicable for current and prior years. Do not defer and amortise in accordance with AASB 1023. Reinsurance expenses must be recognised on a basis that is consistent with the measurement of premiums liabilities as measured in accordance with GPS 310 Audit and Actuarial Reporting and Valuation.                                                   

Recognition of outwards reinsurance expenses will vary according to the type of reinsurance contract:
* Proportional reinsurance (treaty) and all facultative: Premium ceded to the reinsurer(s) is recognised as an expense by the direct insurer on the date of acceptance (date bound) of the underlying insurance contract by the direct insurer.
* Excess of loss reinsurance (treaty): The recognition of outwards reinsurance expense depends on the basis of the cover being either on a &apos;losses occurring during the period of reinsurance&apos; basis or &apos;risks attaching during the period of reinsurance&apos;. 
* Loss occurring during the period of reinsurance: The majority of excess of loss and catastrophe reinsurance is based on a &apos;losses 
occurring during the period of reinsurance&apos; basis. Thus, the reinsurance will provide cover for risks that have been accepted in the prior period and to risks that are accepted and attach in the current period of the reinsurance contract. In the case where the risk profile of the insurer is evenly distributed throughout the year, an insurer must recognise 50 per cent of the excess of loss reinsurance expense in the current period. The reinsurance expense for the remaining 50 per cent is to be recognised at the mid point of the period for the reinsurance cover. Where the risk profile of the insurer is not evenly distributed throughout the year, with material peaks and troughs throughout the year, the insurer will need to recognise the apportionment of the reinsurance expense on the same business pattern as their risk portfolio. For seasonal insurers, with all policies incepting on the one date, all reinsurance expense will need to be recognised from the date of acceptance by the reinsurer of the reinsurance contract.
* Risk attaching during the period of reinsurance: For these reinsurance contracts, the full amount of the excess of loss reinsurance expense is to be recognised from the date of acceptance of the reinsurance by the reinsurer. The minimum and deposit premium for the full period of the reinsurance that is payable to the reinsurer is to be recognised.

Where payments under a reinsurance contract extend beyond the current year of cover, reinsurance expense is to be discounted using similar discount rates as required in measuring insurance liabilities in accordance with GPS 310 Audit and Actuarial Reporting and Valuation.

Do not defer and amortise in accordance with AASB 1023. 
Reinsurance expenses must be recognised on a basis that is consistent with the measurement of premiums liabilities as measured in accordance with GPS 310 Audit and Actuarial Reporting and Valuation.                                                   

Recognition of outwards reinsurance expenses will vary according to the type of reinsurance contract:
* Proportional reinsurance (treaty) and all facultative: Premium ceded to the reinsurer(s) is recognised as an expense by the direct insurer on the date of acceptance (date bound) of the underlying insurance contract by the direct insurer.
* Excess of loss reinsurance (treaty): The recognition of outwards reinsurance expense depends on the basis of the cover being either on a &apos;losses occurring during the period of reinsurance&apos; basis or &apos;risks attaching during the period of reinsurance&apos;. 
* Loss occurring during the period of reinsurance: The majority of excess of loss and catastrophe reinsurance is based on a &apos;losses 
occurring during the period of reinsurance&apos; basis. Thus, the reinsurance will provide cover for risks that have been accepted in the prior period and to risks that are accepted and attach in the current period of the reinsurance contract. In the case where the risk profile of the insurer is evenly distributed throughout the year, an insurer must recognise 50 per cent of the excess of loss reinsurance expense in the current period. The reinsurance expense for the remaining 50 per cent is to be recognised at the mid point of the period for the reinsurance cover. Where the risk profile of the insurer is not evenly distributed throughout the year, with material peaks and troughs throughout the year, the insurer will need to recognise the apportionment of the reinsurance expense on the same business pattern as their risk portfolio. For seasonal insurers, with all policies incepting on the one date, all reinsurance expense will need to be recognised from the date of acceptance by the reinsurer of the reinsurance contract.

Premium revenue must be recognised on a basis that is consistent with the measurement of premiums liabilities as measured in accordance with GPS 310 Audit and Actuarial Reporting and Valuation. 
* Premium revenue includes the value of future premium receipts under existing insurance contracts through to the end of the period of insurance.
* Premium revenue must be discounted where it is to be received beyond the current year of cover under an insurance/reinsurance contract. In these cases, use the discount rate as required in calculating insurance liabilities in accordance with GPS 310 Audit and Actuarial Reporting and Valuation.
* Premium revenue excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties i.e. government stamp duty and taxes.
* Levies charged to insured, such as fire service levies, are to be included as premium revenue.
* Premium refunds and rebates are to be deducted from premium revenue.
* For installment premium policies, the amount of the annualised premium is to be used. * Where premium is calculated on an adjustment basis, the estimated annual premium is to be brought to account, with the estimated premium being replaced by the actual amount as it becomes known.
* Where premium is accepted on a deposit basis, the full annual premium is to be brought into account.
* Premium revenue must be gross of reinsurance expense.
* Premium revenue includes premium receivable on unclosed business. This includes the business which has been accepted by the insurer/reinsurer prior to the balance date but there is insufficient information to fully identify the business.
* Premium revenue relating to insurance/reinsurance contracts written on a long-term basis:
* where the insurer/reinsurer accepting the risk has the option to cancel the contract at pre-agreed dates, premium revenue is to be recognised from the date of acceptance up to the next possible cancellation date.
* where the insurer/reinsurer accepting the risk does not have the option to cancel the contract at pre-agreed dates, the full premium for the long-term insurance/reinsurance contract is to be recognised from the date of acceptance.

Unrealised gains/losses
The change in the net market value is the increase or decrease in the market value of each asset compared to the value of that asset at the beginning of the reporting period. These assets are still owned by the entity at the end of the period, they have not been disposed of, and as a result, the gains or losses on the assets are unrealised.

Only include the movement in the net market value of the asset. Do not include the movement in the value of the currency relative to the Australian dollar if the asset is denominated in a currency other than the Australian dollar.</link:label>
