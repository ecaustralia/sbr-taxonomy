The entrepreneurs&apos; tax offset (ETO) is a tax offset (reduction) available to certain small business entities. For businesses with an aggregated turnover of $50,000 or less, the ETO is 25% of the income tax liability attributable to the portion of taxable income that is business income. 
The ETO phases out if the aggregated turnover is over $50,000, and ceases when the turnover reaches $75,000.
Any entitlement to the ETO can only be applied against the current year&apos;s tax on taxable income. That is, any unused offset cannot be refunded or transferred.</link:label>

If a taxpayer is eligible, this tax offset means that they pay less tax and in some cases may not have to lodge a tax return any more.
To be eligible for the senior Australians tax offset a taxpayer must meet four conditions:
condition 1 - age 
condition 2 - eligibility for Australian Government age pension or similar payments 
condition 3 - taxable income threshold, and 
condition 4 - not in gaol.
If the taxpayer meets all four conditions, the amount of tax offset will vary depending on their taxable income and circumstances. The taxpayer may also be able to transfer to themselves any unused portion of their spouse&apos;s tax offset to help reduce the amount of tax they have to pay.</link:label>
