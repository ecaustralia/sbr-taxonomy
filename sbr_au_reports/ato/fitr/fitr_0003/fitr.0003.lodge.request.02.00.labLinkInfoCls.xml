You would have shown this gross income amount at Labels A â€“ U at item 10. To ensure that that income is not taxed, it is necessary to deduct an identical amount at Y. 
Do not reduce the exempt income shown at Y by the amount of expenses incurred in deriving that income. Doing so will understate the deductible amount of exempt current pension and will result in some of that income being subject to tax.
Expenses incurred in gaining or producing exempt income are not deductible; those expenses should not be shown anywhere at item 11. 
For treatment of expenses incurred wholly or partly in producing assessable income, see deductions: 
â€¢ D Capital works deductions 
â€¢ E Deduction for decline in value of depreciating assets 
â€¢ I Investment expenses 
â€¢ J Management expenses
â€¢ Q Administration expenses, and 
â€¢ L Other deductions.
Pension liabilities are the fund's liabilities to pay superannuation income stream benefits. The exemption on current pension income applies to all funds currently paying pensions. It does not provide an automatic exemption of the fund's total income as certain conditions must be met to obtain an exemption. There are two methods by which the trustee of a fund can determine the exempt income shown at Y. Either one method or both methods may be used depending on the circumstances. Different conditions for claiming the exemption apply, depending on the method used. A fund is entitled to franking credits on franked dividends received, even when the dividends relate to current pension liabilities.</link:label>
