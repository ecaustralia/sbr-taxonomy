This includes for example, State and Local Government unincorporated enterprises which provide goods and services to their government and/or to the public for free or at prices that are not economically significant (e.g. government employee cafeterias, municipal swimming pools, etc.), non-profit institutions controlled and mainly financed by State and Local Government, State Government quasi-corporations which sell their output, at near market prices, exclusively to other Government units (e.g. Government printers), ACT and Northern Territory Government departments and agencies, and state schools, technical and further education colleges and state owned hospitals.

This excludes for example, State and Local Government trading enterprises and financial enterprises (e.g. rail, and municipal water authorities), and State and Territory central borrowings authorities.</link:label>
