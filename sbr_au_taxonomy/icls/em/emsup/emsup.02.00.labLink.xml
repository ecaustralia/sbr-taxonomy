An active member is a member covered by subsection 295-95(3) of the ITAA 1997 if the member is either: a contributor to the fund or an individual on whose behalf contributions are made, unless they are a foreign resident for whom the only contributions made to the fund are payments in respect of a time when they were an Australian resident.
