Amounts can be calculated using the worksheet for the total of the entity maintenance deductions and subtract this amount from  non-PSI income (if any). Allocate any excess between each individual as described in Entity maintenance deductions. Allocate your other PSI deductions to each individual to the extent that the deductions relate to gaining or producing that person's PSI. If a deduction relates to more than one individual, it must be prorated between those individuals. Inform the relevant field with the excess entity maintenance deductions and other deductions for each individual. Add these amounts together and inform the relevant field with the total at total amount of other deductions against personal services income on your PSI schedule.</link:label>
