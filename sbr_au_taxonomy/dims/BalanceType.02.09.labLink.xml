The credit equivalent amount (CEA) represents the on-balance sheet equivalent of an off-balance sheet exposure.

In relation to a non-market-related off-balance sheet transaction, the CEA adjusted for CRM is calculated by multiplying the notional principal amount of a particular transaction, after adjusting for CRM, by the relevant credit conversion factor.

In relation to a market-related off-balance sheet transaction, the CEA adjusted for CRM is determined using the current exposure method, calculated as the notional principal amount, after adjusting for CRM, multiplied by the credit conversion factor, plus the current exposure amount of the particular transaction.</link:label>
