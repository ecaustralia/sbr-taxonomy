For the allocation of cost base in cancellation case, the cost base and reduced cost base of any interests (the new interests) issued by the original entity to an acquiring entity if the original interests of an original interest holder are cancelled under the arrangement; and  the holder obtains a roll-over for the cancellation; and  the holder is a significant stakeholder or a common stakeholder for the arrangement.

    <link:label xlink:type="resource" xlink:label="lbl_DE3290" xlink:role="http://sbr.gov.au/fdtn/sbr.01.02.tech/dataElementGuidance" xml:lang="en">Inform the relevant field with the appropriate symbol.  If a company in which an individual owned shares was taken over and that individual  received new shares in the takeover company, there may be an entitlement to scrip-for-scrip rollover. The individual may also be eligible for this rollover if the individual exchanged a unit or other interest in a fixed trust, for a similar interest in another fixed trust.  Scrip-for-scrip rollover is not available if a share is exchanged for a unit or other interest in a fixed trust, or if a unit or other interest in a fixed trust is exchanged for a share. The individual can only choose the rollover if that individual has made a capital gain from such an exchange on or after 10 December 1999.  Rollover does not apply to a capital loss. Rollover is only available if the exchange is in consequence of an arrangement that results in the acquiring entity (or the wholly owned group of which it is a member) becoming the owner of 80% or more of the original company or trust. For companies, the arrangement must be one in which all owners of voting shares in the original entity can participate.  For trusts, this means all owners of trust voting interests in the original entity or, if there are no voting interests, all owners of units or other fixed interests can participate. There are special rules if a company or trust has a small number of shareholders or beneficiaries or there is a significant common stakeholder.  If the company or trust does not let the individual know, further information will be required about whether the conditions have been satisfied.  The rollover allows the individual to disregard the capital gain made from the original shares, units or other interest. The individual is taken to have acquired the replacement shares, units or other interest for the cost base of the original interest. The individual can apply the CGT discount when disposing of new shares providing the combined period that the individual owned the original shares and the new shares is at least 12 months. The same applies to units in a trust. Note that the individual is required to deduct any capital losses (including unapplied net capital losses from earlier years) from any capital gains before applying the CGT discount. The individual may only be eligible for partial rollover if there is an  exchange of shares, units or interests for similar interests in another entity (replacement interest) plus something else, usually cash. This is because rollover applies only to the replacement interest. The individual will need to apportion the cost base of the original interest between the replacement interest and the cash (or other proceeds not eligible for rollover). If the individual's original shares, units or other interests were acquired before 20 September 1985 (pre-CGT), the individual is not eligible for scrip-for-scrip rollover. Instead, the individual will acquire the replacement interest at the time of the exchange and the replacement interest is no longer a pre-CGT asset. However, if the arrangement is one that would otherwise qualify for scrip-for-scrip rollover, the cost base of the replacement interest is its market value just after the acquisition.</link:label>
