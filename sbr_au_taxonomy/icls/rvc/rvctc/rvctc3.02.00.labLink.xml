Life insurance companies separate their taxable income into two classes - the ordinary class and the complying superannuation class - and multiply the taxable income of each class by the appropriate tax rate to determine their gross tax. Where a life insurance company is an Retirement Savings Account provider and there is no Tax File Number contributions income the tax rate is determined in accordance with section 29 of the Income Tax Rates Act 1986.
The taxable incomes of the complying superannuation class and the ordinary class are worked out separately.
Tax losses of one class can only be applied to reduce future income of the same class.</link:label>

The primary purpose of the scheme was to maintain competitiveness in business, and particularly in key export industries such as mining and agriculture.

The Fuel Tax Credit Scheme commenced on 1 July 2006 and replaced the Energy Grants Credits Scheme. Essentially, the Fuel Tax Credit Scheme is the same as the Energy Grants Credit Scheme, except that businesses participating in the scheme now claim credits in dollars on their Business Activity Statements (BAS) instead of in litres of fuel used.

Energy Grants Credits Scheme fuel tax credits netted off cost of diesel oil and fuel purchases refers to the value of any credits which have been deducted from the value of purchases of diesel oil and fuel already reported.</link:label>

In most cases it does not apply to exports of goods or services, and other things consumed outside Australia. It is similar to 'value-added taxes' applying in other countries. The GST is a multi-stage tax, that is, GST is paid at each stage of the supply chain. Liability for this tax rests on the supplier. Usually the supplier adjusts the price of a taxable supply to reflect the GST payable on the supply. However, if the supplier does not adjust the price to reflect the GST, it is still liable to pay the GST to the Tax Office. GST replaced the wholesale sales tax and the excise surcharge payable on petroleum and tobacco products which the Australian Government collected and reimbursed to the states and territories under agreed repayment schemes.</link:label>
