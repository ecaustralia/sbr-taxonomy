Derivatives are generally defined as those instruments/contracts, where the value is based on other products, and/or on prices associated with financial products. Derivative contracts involve:
- Future delivery, receipt or exchange of financial items such as cash or another derivative instrument; or
- Future exchange of real assets for financial items where the contract may be tradeable and has a market value.
The contracts can either be binding on both parties (e.g. as with a currency swap) or subject to the exercise by one party of a right contained within the contract (as with options).</link:label>

Realised gains/losses
Where the entity disposed of an asset during the relevant period, the value of the gain or loss from the disposal is to be reported.
If an asset has not been disposed of during the annual relevant period, then any gains or losses are unrealised.
Only include the movement in the market value of the asset, do not include the movement in the value of the currency relative to the local currency if the asset is denominated in a currency other than the local currency.

Equity investments or securities are, as defined by the Australian Accounting Standards, contracts that evidence a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all its liabilities.</link:label>
