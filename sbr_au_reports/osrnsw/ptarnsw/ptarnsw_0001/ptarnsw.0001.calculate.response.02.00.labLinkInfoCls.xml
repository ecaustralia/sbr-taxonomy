Therefore, only when an employer joins or leaves a group during the employing period is there a change. This can occur as a result of a change in control of another business eg due to the acquisition or sale of voting shares or the appointment of an administrator or liquidator, or as there are no longer common employees.   

For example, if A, B and C are members of a group and B leaves the group, then the structure of the group has changed. Or, if a new employer, D, joins the group, then the structure of the group has also changed.

A part period calculation is required whenever there is a change in the structure of a group. This is because the group threshold entitlement changes in accordance with the change in the structure of the group.  

For example, A, B and C employed in NSW during the period 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2009. They were members of the same group during the period 1 July 2008 to 31 December 2008 and B left the group on 1 January 2009 and was a non-grouped employer during the period 1 January 2009 to 30 June 2009.  A and C continued to be grouped during the period 1 January 2009 to 30 June 2009.  

Part period calculations are required for A, B and C to account for the change in group structure on 1 January 2009. The first part period relates to 1 July 2008 to 31 December 2008, when A, B and C were members of the same group and the group threshold entitlement for this part period is calculated in accordance with the number of days in the period and the total Australian wages paid by the three members of the group during that period.  

The second part period for A and C relates to 1 January 2009 to 30 June 2009, when they continued to be members of the same group. Once again, the group threshold entitlement for this part period is calculated in accordance with the number of days in the period and the total Australian wages paid by the two members of the group during that period.  The second part period for B relates to 1 January 2009 to 30 June 2009 when B was a non-grouped employer. B's threshold entitlement for this part period is calculated in accordance with the number of days in the period and the total Australian wages paid by B during that period.  </link:label>

If you're an individual employer and didn't employ for the full financial year in Australia, you're only entitled to a portion of the maximum threshold entitlement based on the number of days you employed during the financial year. That is, the number of days your business employed any employees anywhere in Australia determines the number of days threshold available to you in NSW in a given financial year.  

For example, if your business employed in Victoria for the full financial year, but only opened a branch in NSW in November, you would still be entitled to the full year's threshold in NSW, although this would be divided pro-rata between the two states.  </link:label>

Total group NSW wages divided by Total group Australian wages (multiplied by number of days employed during the financial year divided by 365) multiplied by the maximum threshold entitlement.  

If you paid any liable interstate wages it reduces the threshold entitlement applied to the gross NSW wages. 

Only one member of the group can claim the group's NSW threshold entitlement. This member is known as the Designated Group Employer (DGE). Grouped employers are required to nominate a DGE for their group. This must be a group member with Australian wages exceeding the threshold. If you are not the DGE, you do not receive any threshold entitlement.  

If none of the members have Australian wages exceeding the threshold, you must nominate a single lodger to be responsible for lodging and paying Payroll Tax on behalf of all members of the group. 

Refer to www.osr.nsw.gov.au for the threshold entitlement applicable to the current financial year.</link:label>

The other group members are not required to make individual payments or lodge an annual reconciliation. A request in writing must have been made and advice received from OSR of approval to be the nominated single lodger.  

A single lodger does not include an accountant or accounts clerk who may calculate the payroll tax payable and make payments on behalf of more than one company. In this instance, each individual company is still required to make their own payment to OSR and lodge their own annual reconciliation in July each year.  

The following checklist will assist you in determining whether you are a single lodger.    
- Are you a member of a group? Yes/No 
- Have you received advice from OSR that you are a single lodger? Yes/No 
- Do you calculate the payroll tax payable by the group each month on behalf of all member of the group? Yes/No 
- Do you pay the total payroll tax payable for the group on behalf of all members of the group? Yes/No 
- Do the other group members advise you of their gross NSW wages and gross interstate wages each month? Yes/No 
- Out of all group members, are you the only group member that makes individual payments to OSR? Yes/No 
- Are you responsible for lodging the annual reconciliation and making the June payment on behalf of all group members? Yes/No

If you answered 'yes' to all the above questions, you are a single lodger. </link:label>
