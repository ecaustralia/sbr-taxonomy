A type 1 aggregate applies if the employer  (or a member of the same
GST group) are entitled to a GST credit for goods or services
acquired in providing fringe benefits. GST affects the calculation of an employerâ€™s FBT liability. Where the benefit provider is entitled to a GST credit for goods or services acquired to provide fringe benefits, a higher gross-up rate (type 1) applies when calculating the FBT liability. The higher gross-up rate recovers the GST credit the benefit provider is entitled to.</link:label>

Where there is no entitlement to a GST credit, the lower gross-up rate (type 2) applies. Type 2 fringe benefits are those for which the employer canâ€™t claim a GST credit because: - it is not entitled to (for example, youâ€™re not registered for GST), or -  there are no GST credits available (that is the benefit is GST-free such as school fees, or input taxed, such as housing other than commercial accommodation).</link:label>
