All commodity positions, both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet, which are affected by changes in commodity prices, should be included. This includes commodity forwards, commodity futures and commodity swaps. It also includes the delta-equivalent of commodity options (where the delta-plus method for options is used). Commodity derivatives should be converted into notional commodity positions according to the methods set out in APS 116.

Each commodity position should first be expressed in terms of the standard unit of measurement (e.g. barrels, kilos, grams) and then converted into Australian dollars using spot rates applying at the close of business on the reporting date (report the AUD figure). If prior approval has been obtained from APRA, positions in foreign currency denominated commodities may be segmented into a commodity exposure and a foreign currency exposure.

The capital charge must be calculated separately for each commodity. Positions in different commodities may not, as a general rule, be offset (refer to APS 116 for details of permissible offsetting).

The capital charge is calculated for each commodity as 15 per cent of the net open position (the difference between the total short position and the total long position) plus 3 per cent of the gross position (the sum of the absolute values of the total short position and the total long position).</link:label>
