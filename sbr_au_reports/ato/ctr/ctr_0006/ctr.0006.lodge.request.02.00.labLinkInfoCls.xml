If the difference is not more than $5,000, the company can still choose to conduct a stocktake and account for changes in the value of trading stock if it wishes.
If the difference between the value of the opening stock and a reasonable estimate of its closing stock is more than $5,000, the company must account for changes in the value of its trading stock. 

All other companies:
Inform the total value of all trading stock on hand at  the end of the income year or accounting period for which the company tax return is being prepared. The amount at this label is the value calculated for income tax purposes under section 70-45 of the ITAA 1997.
If the company is registered or required to be registered for GST, the value of closing stock should not include an amount equal to the input tax credit that the company has claimed or is entitled to claim. Input tax credits do not arise for some items of trading stock, such as shares.
Include floor plan stock and work in progress of manufactured goods.
Do not include any amount that represents closing stock of a business that ceased operations during the income year. Include this amount at Income,  Other gross income.</link:label>

The total of the Companyâ€™s deductions allowable for eligible business related capital expenditure it incurred that is not otherwise deductible or taken into account, and for which a deduction is not denied by some other provision. Taxpayer's are provided a five-year write-off for certain business related capital expenditure incurred in relation to a past, present or proposed business. The deduction applies to business-related capital expenditure incurred after 30 June 2005. Generally, the expenditure is only deductible to the extent the business is, was or is proposed to be carried on for a taxable purpose. A deduction cannot be claimed for capital expenditure to the extent that it:
- can be deducted under another provision of the income tax laws
- forms part of the cost of a depreciating asset the Company holds, used to hold or will hold
- forms part of the cost of land
- relates to a lease or other legal or equitable right
- would be taken into account in working out an assessable profit or deductible loss
- could be taken into account in working out a capital gain or a capital loss from a CGT event
- would be specifically not deductible under the income tax laws if the expenditure was not capital expenditure
- is specifically not deductible under the income tax laws for a reason other than that the expenditure is capital expenditure
- is of a private or domestic nature
- is incurred in relation to gaining or producing exempt income or non-assessable non-exempt income
- is excluded from the cost or cost base of an asset because, under special rules in the UCA or capital gains tax regimes respectively, the cost or cost base of the asset was taken to be the market value, or
- is a return of or on capital (for example, distributions by trustees) or a return of a non-assessable amount (for example, repayments of loan principal).
The Company deducts 20% of the qualifying capital expenditure in the year it is incurred and in each of the following four years.</link:label>

The deduction claimed for capital expenditure on qualifying buildings and structural improvements, including eligible capital expenditure on extensions, alterations or improvements to either of these. Exclude capital expenditure for mining infrastructure buildings and timber milling buildings. Different deduction rates apply (2.5% or 4%) depending on the date on which construction began, the type of capital works and the manner of use. The Company can claim a deduction under Division 43 for an income year only if it owns, leases or holds part of a construction expenditure area of capital works (â€˜your areaâ€™), incurred the construction expenditure or is an assignee of the lessee or holder who incurred the expense, and uses â€˜your areaâ€™ to produce assessable income or in some cases for carrying on R&amp;D activities. A lessee or holder can claim a deduction in respect of an area leased or held under a quasi-ownership right. The Company can deduct an amount for capital works in an income year if the capital works have a â€˜construction expenditure areaâ€™, there is a â€˜pool of construction expenditureâ€™ for that area, and the company uses the area in the income year to produce assessable income or carry on research and development activities. No deduction until construction is complete. The deduction cannot exceed the undeducted construction expenditure for your area.</link:label>

The following items are shown here:
- The excess of the companyâ€™s foreign source income and attributed foreign income for taxation purposes over income from such sources shown in the accounts. Gross up foreign source income by the amount of foreign tax paid. Include any add-back or subtraction adjustment to expenses claimed against such income separately at Non-deductible expenses or at Other deductible expense.
- Assessable foreign exchange gains to the extent that they have not been included at Calculation of total profit or loss, or at any other label of Reconciliation to taxable income or loss. See Foreign exchange gains and losses on the ATO website for more information.
- Assessable balancing adjustment amounts for non-R&amp;D assets. (Assessable balancing adjustment amounts for assets used in R&amp;D activities subject to the R&amp;D tax concession are taken into account at L Australian owned R&amp;D tax concession â€“ not including Australian owned R&amp;D â€“ extra incremental 50% deduction.)
Note: Assessable balancing adjustment amounts for assets
used in foreign-owned R&amp;D activities are not subject to
the R&amp;D tax concession and should not be included
in Accounting expenditure in 'Calculation of total profit t or loss' subject to R&amp;D tax concession, Australian owned R&amp;D tax concession â€“ not including 'Australian owned R&amp;D â€“ extra incremental 50% deduction', or Foreign owned R&amp;D tax concession â€“ not including 'Foreign owned R&amp;D â€“ extra incremental 75% deduction'.
If the company ceases to hold or to use a depreciating
asset, a balancing adjustment event occurs. For
assets subject to the small business entity depreciation
rules, see the ATO website Step 5 of Disposal of depreciating assets. For assets not subject to the small business entity depreciation rules, calculate a balancing adjustment amount to include in the companyâ€™s
assessable income or to claim as a deduction.
If the asset was used for both taxable and non-taxable
purposes, reduce the balancing adjustment amount by
the amount attributable to the non-taxable use. A capital
gain or capital loss amount may arise attributable to that
non-taxable use. For more information, see the ATO website Guide to
depreciating assets.
- The companyâ€™s share of a deduction in respect of a
â€˜listed investment company (LIC) capital gainâ€™ amount
if it receives a distribution from a partnership or trust
that claimed a deduction in respect of a LIC capital gain
amount â€“ see section 115-280 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. There is an exception for life insurance companies. For more
information, see the ATO website for Company Instructions in the section on Life insurance companies and friendly societies only.
- Excessive deductions for capital allowances that are
to be included in assessable income under the limited
recourse debt rules
- Amounts assessable under Division 45 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Broadly, if a taxpayer holds plant which has been used
principally for leasing and some part of the lease period
occurred on or after 22 February 1999, Division 45 and
related amendments may apply from that date to include
an amount in the assessable income of the taxpayer
upon disposal of such plant, or an interest in the plant,
or an interest in, or rights under, a lease of the plant.</link:label>

Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) assessable income is the sum of:
- non-CGT assessable income derived from an SME investment or derived from the disposal of an SME investment at a time when the company was a PDF, and
- the overall capital gain allocated to the SME assessable income class.

The overall capital gain allocated to the SME assessable income class is the amount of any ordinary capital gain that would otherwise arise from a Capital Gain Tax (CGT) event at a time the company was a Pooled Development Fund (PDF) in relation to an SME investment less: 
- any ordinary capital loss for that class, and
- any overall capital loss from another class of assessable income, and then
- any prior year net capital losses.
Capital gains in one class of assessable income are first reduced by capital losses in that class and then by capital losses in another class. Prior year capital losses are applied first against capital gains in the SME assessable income class.

Full-year PDF
For a company that is a PDF for the full income year, the SME income component is SME assessable income less deductions allowable to the PDF for the income year.

Part-year PDF
A company that becomes a PDF part way through the income year and is still a PDF at the end of the income year is taxed as a PDF from the day it became registered as a PDF to the end of the income year as if that period were an income year (â€˜the PDF periodâ€™). The PDF component is
the taxable income for the PDF period. (A companyâ€™s â€˜PDF componentâ€™ is its â€˜adjusted taxable incomeâ€™.)

The SME income component of a part-year PDF is the companyâ€™s SME assessable income less any deductions allowable to the company for the income year that relate to the PDF period.</link:label>

Enter all assessable income less deductions that equals the amount at this field â€˜Total profit or loss' plus or minus the reconciliation adjustments plus the amount shown at â€˜R&amp;D tax offset, if chosenâ€™. If the company has a taxable income of $1 or more, transfer the amount at â€˜Taxable income or lossâ€™ to â€˜Taxable or net incomeâ€™ in the calculation statement. The companyâ€™s tax loss at â€˜Taxable income or lossâ€™ is the excess of its total deductions (except tax losses for earlier income years) over its total assessable income and net exempt income â€“ see section 36-10 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. If the amount is a loss, ensure it is represented as a negative number. The companyâ€™s net exempt income is calculated under section 36-20 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and is not necessarily equal to the amount written at â€˜Exempt incomeâ€™. Check that the amount at â€˜Other assessable incomeâ€™ includes the amount of net exempt income taken into account in calculating the companyâ€™s tax loss. If the company has a tax loss at this label, print zero (0) at â€˜Taxable or net incomeâ€™ in the â€˜Calculation statementâ€™. If the company has excess franking offsets that can be converted under section 36-55 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 into a tax loss to be carried forward, do not include at this field the amount of that tax loss. However, that amount should be taken into account in calculating the companyâ€™s tax loss at â€˜Tax losses carried forward to later income yearsâ€™. This means that a company may have a taxable income at â€˜Taxable income or lossâ€™ and a tax loss carried forward.  Alternatively, if the companyâ€™s total deductions exceed total assessable income and net exempt income, it would show an amount at this field that, disregarding section 36-55, would have been its tax loss for the income year.</link:label>

For Companies that are not an eligible small business entity that has chosen to use the simplified depreciation rules, this is the book depreciation expenses for depreciating assets. This amount does not include profit on sale of depreciating assets or loss on sale of depreciating assets. If the Company is an eligible small business entity and has chosen to use the simplified depreciation rules, this is the total depreciation deductions being claimed under the simplified depreciation rules and the uniform capital allowances (UCA) rules. Small business entities can claim an immediate deduction for most depreciating assets costing less than $1,000 each (excluding input tax credit entitlements) and pool most of their other depreciating assets.

Under the existing law, balancing adjustment amounts are not to be included in the calculation of PAYG instalment income. This amount will be one of a variety of things included in taxpayerâ€™s TOFA gains/losses reported at Item 7. As such it is necessary to separately identify this amount so as to ensure this amount is not included in the calculation of a taxpayerâ€™s PAYG instalment income. It will be possible to remove this label in Taxtime 2016 as the balancing adjustment provisions only apply to the first 4 years the Division 230 applies to a taxpayer.

Life insurance companies separate their taxable income into classes â€“ the ordinary class and the complying superannuation class/ FHSA class â€“ and multiply the taxable income of each class by the appropriate tax rate to determine their gross tax. Where a life insurance company is an RSA provider and there is no TFN contributions income the tax rate is determined in accordance with section 29 of the Income Tax Rates Act 1986.
The taxable incomes of the complying superannuation class/ FHSA class and the ordinary class are worked out separately.
Tax losses of one class can only be applied to reduce future income of the same class.
If the company is a life insurance company that is not a member of a consolidated group and has complying superannuation class tax losses carried forward to later income years or virtual PST net capital losses carried forward to later income years, complete a Losses schedule.

The head company of a consolidated or MEC group that has one or more subsidiary members that are life insurance companies at any time during the income year is also taken to be a life insurance company for the purposes of applying the income tax law.
If the head company has tax losses of the complying superannuation class/ FHSA class or net capital losses from virtual PST assets carried forward to later income years, it will need to complete a Consolidated groups losses schedule.</link:label>

Can claim a deduction for the decline in value of a water facility in equal instalments over three years.
The Company's total deductions for landcare operation expenses and for the decline in value of water facilities. The Company can claim a deduction in the year it incurs capital expenditure on a landcare operation for land in Australia. Unless the Company is a rural land irrigation water provider, the deduction is available to the extent the Company uses the land for either a primary production business, or in the case of rural land, carrying on a business for a taxable purpose from the use of that land â€“ except a business of mining or quarrying. The Company may claim the deduction even if it is only a lessee of the land. The deduction is also available to rural land irrigation water providers â€“ that is, to entities whose business is primarily and principally the supply of water (other than by using a motor vehicle) to entities for use in primary production businesses on land in Australia or to businesses (other than mining or quarrying businesses) using rural land in Australia. If the Company is a rural land irrigation water provider, it can claim a deduction for capital expenditure it incurs on a landcare operation for land in Australia that other entities â€“ being entities supplied with water by the company â€“ use at the time for carrying on primary production businesses, or rural land in Australia that other entities â€“ being entities supplied with water by the company â€“ use at the time for carrying on businesses for a taxable purpose from the use of that land (except a business of mining or quarrying). A rural land irrigation water providerâ€™s deduction is reduced by a reasonable amount to reflect an entityâ€™s use of the land for other than a taxable purpose after the water provider incurred the expenditure. A deduction cannot be claimed if the capital expenditure is on plant unless it is on certain fences, dams or other structural improvements. The Company can claim a deduction for the decline in value of a water facility in equal instalments over three years. A water facility is plant or a structural improvement that is primarily or principally for the purpose of conserving or conveying water, or a structural improvement that is reasonably incidental to conserving or conveying water. It also includes a repair of a capital nature, or an alteration, addition or extension, to that plant or structural improvement. Unless the Company is an irrigation water provider, the expenditure must be incurred by the company primarily and principally for conserving or conveying water for use in its primary production business on land in Australia. The Company may claim the deduction even if it is only a lessee of the land. The deduction is reduced if the facility is not wholly used for either carrying on a primary production business on land in Australia, or a taxable purpose. The deduction for water facilities is also available to irrigation water providers â€“ that is, to entities whose business is primarily and principally the supply (other than by using a motor vehicle) of water to other entities for use in a primary production business on land in Australia. If the company is an irrigation water provider, it must incur the expenditure on the water facility primarily and principally for conserving or conveying water for use in primary production businesses conducted by other entities on land in Australia â€“ being entities supplied with water by the Company. The Companyâ€™s deduction is reduced if the water facility is not wholly used for a taxable purpose.</link:label>

To ensure the company receives the correct amount of credit for its PAYG instalments, make sure all of its activity statements are lodged before its income tax return is lodged. Lodge any outstanding activity statements even if the company has paid the instalments or had nothing to pay.
The company is entitled to a credit for its PAYG instalments even if it has not actually paid a particular instalment.
However, the company will be liable for the general interest charge on any outstanding instalment for the period from the due date for the instalment until the date it is fully paid.
This label is only to be used for the quarterly or annual instalments raised during the financial year. The amount recorded at the label must not include â€˜wash upâ€™ or residual payments.

A head company is entitled to claim credit for its own instalments plus any subsidiary memberâ€™s instalments that are attributable to the period the subsidiary was a member of the consolidated or MEC group during the head companyâ€™s income year.
If a subsidiary was a member of a particular consolidated or MEC group for only part of the head companyâ€™s income year, the head company can claim an amount of instalment credit that can be reasonably attributed to the period the subsidiary member was part of the head companyâ€™s consolidated or MEC group.
This element is the total amount of instalments as above for the head company and those claimed for subsidiary members.
Instalment credits belonging to a subsidiary member not attributable to and claimed by a head company may be claimed by the subsidiary member against its assessment.</link:label>

The amount of tax losses transferred to the company from group companies under Subdivision 170-A of the ITAA 1997. A group company may transfer the whole or part of a tax loss to another company where:
- both companies are members of the same wholly owned group, and
- one of the companies is - an Australian branch of a foreign bank, or - an Australian PE of a foreign financial entity if the tax loss is for an income year commencing on or after June 2005, and
- the other company is - the head company of a consolidated or MEC group, or - not a member of a consolidatable group, and
- further conditions In Subdivisions 170-A of the ITAA 1997 are satisfied.

The tax loss transferred to the income company is deductible to the income company in accordance with the provisions of the section 36-17 of the ITAA 1997. For example, the tax loss transferred to the income company is first offset against the income company's net exempt income, then against its assessable income.
- Tax losses transferred cannot be used to create a tax loss.
- The Commissioner has power in certain circumstances to amend assessments to disallow a deduction for an amount of transferred tax loss despite section 170 - see section 170-70 of the ITAA 1997. Consolidated groups tax losses cannot be transferred to a head company from subsidiary companies under Subdivision 170-A if the ITAA 1997 when consolidation occurs part way through the head company's income year.  Therefore, Tax losses transferred in (from or to: a foreign bank branch or a PE of a foreign financial entity ) is not applicable in this circumstance.
Do not show tax losses transferred from subsidiary companies under Subdivision 707-A if the ATAA 1997. These losses should be shown in the consolidated groups losses schedule for the year.</link:label>

CGT events are the different types of transactions or events that may result in a capital gain or capital loss. Many CGT events involve a CGT asset â€“ for example, the disposal of a CGT asset â€“ while other CGT events relate directly to capital receipts (capital proceeds). An Australian resident company makes a capital gain or capital loss if a CGT event happens to any of its worldwide CGT assets. A company that is not an Australian resident company makes a capital gain or capital loss, generally speaking, if a CGT event happens to any of its CGT assets which have the necessary connection with Australia just before the CGT event happens. If the company ceases to hold or to use a depreciating asset that was used for both taxable and non-taxable purposes, a CGT event may happen to the asset. A capital gain or capital loss may arise to the extent that the asset was used for a non-taxable purpose. For more information about CGT events, see the ATO website. The Guide to capital gains tax includes:

- a capital gain or capital loss worksheet for calculating a capital gain or capital loss for each CGT event
- a CGT summary worksheet for calculating the companyâ€™s net capital gain or capital loss
- a CGT schedule.

Completion of the worksheets is not mandatory. Do not attach them to the company tax return â€“ keep them with the companyâ€™s tax records. However, if the company has:
- total current year capital gains are greater than $10,000, or
- total current year capital losses are year greater than $10,000
complete a CGT schedule and attach it to the company tax return</link:label>

Any company that is a subsidiary member of a consolidated group at the end of the income year is not required to complete Losses Information item. Other companies, including the head company of a consolidated group at the end of the income year, may need to complete Losses Information item.

Net exempt income (if any) must be taken into account in calculating the amount of tax losses carried forward to a later income year â€“ see sections 36-10 and 36-17 of the ITAA 1997.

If the company is a designated infrastructure entity, ensure the amount of the uplift of tax losses is included in tax losses carried forward to later income years.

If the company has claimed a loss carry back tax offset, ensure the amount of tax losses chosen to be carried back is not included in tax losses carried forward to later income
years.

Tax losses carried forward may be affected by the commercial debt forgiveness provisions. 

Under sections 36-17 and 36-55 of the ITAA 1997 a company is:
- subject to certain limitations, able to choose the amount of prior year tax losses it wishes to deduct in a later year of income from the excess (if any) of its assessable income over total deductions (other than tax losses).
Providing choice means that companies can choose not to deduct prior year losses in order to pay sufficient tax to be able to frank their distributions
- able, in certain circumstances, to convert excess franking offsets into a tax loss for the income year and carry forward the tax loss for consideration as a deduction in a later income year.

If the company has excess franking offsets at  Excess franking offsets , calculate the companyâ€™s tax loss for the income year under the method statement in subsection 36-55(2) of the ITAA 1997 as follows:
Step 1. Work out the amount (if any) that would have been the companyâ€™s tax loss for the year under section 36-10, 165-70, 175-35 or 701-30 of the ITAA 1997, disregarding any net exempt income.
Step 2. Divide the amount of excess franking offsets by the corporate tax rate.
Step 3. Add the result of steps 1 and 2.
Step 4. Take away the companyâ€™s net exempt income (if any).
The result (if a positive amount) is the companyâ€™s tax loss for the income year. Include this amount in this field with any unapplied prior year(s) tax loss(es).

If a company is required to complete a Losses schedule, the amount of the tax losses carried forward to later income years in part A of that schedule must be the same as the amount shown in this field.

Do not include any net capital losses to be carried forward to later income years â€“ inform  these separately at Net capital losses carried forward to later income years and in the CGT schedule, if a CGT schedule is required.

If a head company is required to complete a Consolidated groups losses schedule, the amount of the tax losses shown at  Tax losses carried forward to later income years in part A of that schedule must also be the same as the amount shown in this field.

If the company is a subsidiary member of a consolidated group at the end of the income year, this field is not applicable.</link:label>

Advances or loans to shareholders or associates may represent a distribution of profits and may be assessed to the recipient as unfranked dividends.
A loan made in the income year by a private company to a shareholder (or associate of a shareholder) may be repaid or put on a commercial footing, before the earlier of the due date for lodgment or the date of lodgment of the private companyâ€™s income tax return for the year in which the loan is made, in order to prevent the loan from being treated as a deemed dividend.

The net amount of commercial debts forgiven must be applied to reduce the companyâ€™s deductible revenue losses, net capital losses, certain undeducted revenue or capital expenditure and the cost base of certain CGT assets, in that order.
Calculate the net forgiven amount as follows:
1. Determine the notional value of the debt. In the general case, this is the lesser of
-the value of the debt at the time of forgiveness (assuming the company was solvent at that time and the time the debt was incurred), and
- the value of the debt at the time of forgiveness (assuming solvency as above and no changes in market variables) plus any amounts that are allowable as deductions as a result of the debt forgiveness and that are attributable to market movements that occurred while the debt was held. Special rules apply in calculating the notional value of non-recourse debt and in respect of debt parking circumstances. 
2. Calculate the gross forgiven amount of the debt by deducting from the notional value of the debt any amount of consideration provided in respect of the forgiveness.  This consideration normally is the sum of the amounts of money the company is required to pay in respect of the forgiveness or, if property is required to be given, the market value of the property. Special rules apply in determining the consideration given for the forgiveness if a debt is forgiven in exchange for shares, if there are debt parking circumstances, or if money or property is applied for the benefit or at the direction of the creditor - see sections 245-65 and 245-70 of Schedule 2C to the ITAA 1936.</link:label>

There are two methods to account for bad debt:
Direct write off method (Non - GAAP) - A receivable which is not considered collectible is charged directly to the income statement.
Allowance method (GAAP) - An estimate is made at the end of each fiscal year of the amount of bad debt. This is then accumulated in a provision which is then used to reduce specific receivable accounts as and when necessary.
Include recovery of bad debts at Other gross income. A deduction for bad debts is not allowable unless the debt that is bad has previously been included in assessable income, or is for money lent in the ordinary course of the business of lending money by a company carrying on that business.
Do not include accounting provisions for doubtful debts at this field, but at all other expenses and add them back at Non-deductible expenses.
Before a bad debt can be claimed, it must be bad and not merely doubtful. The deduction depends on the facts in each case and, where applicable, the action taken for recovery.
A deduction can also be claimed for:
- partial debt write-offs where only part of a debt is bad and is written off
- losses incurred in debt and equity swaps for debt extinguished after 26 February 1992 if the legal provisions are satisfied. Under these provisions, a deduction may be allowable for the difference between the amount of the debt extinguished and the greater of the market value of the equity or the value at which the equity is recorded in the creditorâ€™s books at the time of issue. The market value of the equity is the price quoted on the stock exchange or, if the equity is not listed, the net asset backing of the equity.
If the taxpayer is not in the business of lending money, the deduction is limited to the amount of the debt included in assessable income.
A deduction for a bad debt or loss on a debt and equity swap is only allowable if the company claiming the deduction satisfies:
- a continuity of ownership test (or we consider it unreasonable to have to satisfy the test), or
- the same business test (if the continuity of ownership test is not satisfied or it is not practicable to show that it is).
Where a debt was incurred in an income year prior to that in which it is written off as bad, the company must satisfy the continuity of ownership test at all times from the date on which the debt was incurred through to the end of the income year in which it writes off the debt.
Where a debt was both incurred and written off as bad in the same income year, the company must satisfy the continuity of ownership test at all times during that income year. A company cannot deduct a debt that is both incurred and written off as bad on the last day of the income year.
Deductions for bad debts may also be reduced by the commercial debt forgiveness provisions.
Special rules apply to determine if the head company of a consolidated or MEC group can deduct a bad debt that for a period has been owed to a member of a consolidated or MEC group and for another period has been owed to an entity that was not a member of that group.</link:label>

If the company has any item of a capital nature at this field, add it back at Non-deductible expenses.
Provided it is not expenditure of a capital nature, the company may deduct the cost of repairs to property, plant, machinery or equipment used for producing assessable income or in carrying on a business for that purpose.
Expenditure on repairs to property used partially for business or income-producing purposes â€“ for example, where the property is also used for private purposes, or in the production of exempt income â€“ is deductible only to the extent that is reasonable in the circumstances.
If items are newly acquired, including by way of a legacy or gift, the cost of remedying defects in existence at the time of acquisition is generally of a capital nature. Expenditure incurred in making alterations, additions or improvements is of a capital nature and is not deductible when incurred.
However, it may be subject to depreciation under the UCA or another capital allowance regime.

If there is a deficit balance in the franking account at the end of the income year, the company must lodge a Franking account tax return and pay Franking Deficit Tax(FDT) by the last day of the month following the end of the income year. If the company is a late balancing company that has elected to have its FDT liability determined on 30 June of financial year, it must lodge its franking account tax return on or before 31 July of financial year.
If the company is a Pooled Development Fund (PDF) and its venture capital sub-account is in deficit at the end of the PDFâ€™s income year or immediately before it ceases to be a PDF, the company is liable to pay venture capital deficit tax. If the PDF has a liability to venture capital deficit tax, a Venture capital deficit tax return must be lodged.

Note:
- Shareholder loans and other advances made by private companies that are deemed dividends are not frankable unless a section in the ITAA 1936 or ITAA 1997 provides that the dividend can be franked. For example, where the Commissioner exercises a limited power to permit the deemed dividend to be franked, or where the deemed dividend is paid in connection with a relationship breakdown.
- Deemed dividends may also arise when a shareholder (or associate of such shareholder) of a private company that has (or will have by a certain time) an unpaid present entitlement from a trust estate receives a payment or loan or has a debt forgiven in their favour by the trustee of the trust estate. However, this will not result in a debit to the franking account of the private company with the unpaid present entitlement.
- A company determines whether its franking account needs adjustment, because the measures may affect imputation benefits available to shareholders, deny franking credits or give rise to additional franking debits. 
For more detailed information on the simplified imputation system, visit the ATO website.

If the company was a subsidiary member of a consolidated or MEC group at the end of the income year and is completing a tax return because of any non-membership periods, inform in this field its franking account balance as at the end of the latest non-membership period if it is a surplus balance. If there is a deficit balance at the end of any non-membership period, the company must lodge a franking account tax return and pay the FDT.</link:label>

Do not include dividends paid by one member to another within a consolidated or MEC group.
Under Division 7A of Part III of the ITAA 1936, payments,  loans and debts forgiven â€“ unless they come within specified exclusion - by a private company to a shareholder or associates of a shareholder are treated as assessable dividends to the extent of the private companyâ€™s distributable surplus as defined in Division 7A.
A payment made in the income year by a private company to a shareholder (or associate of a shareholder) can be converted into a loan before the end of the private companyâ€™s lodgment day that is defined to be the earlier of the due date for lodgment or the date of lodgment of the companyâ€™s income tax return for the year in which the loan is made.
Loans, and payments converted to loans in the income year, made by a private company to a shareholder (or associate of a shareholder) that are not repaid, may be put on a commercial footing before the private companyâ€™s lodgment day. This will prevent the loan from being treated
as a deemed dividend.
Do not include a dividend paid under a demerger at this label unless the head entity of the demerger group has elected under subsection 44(2) of the ITAA 1936 that it be treated as an assessable dividend.</link:label>

An entity that is a corporate tax entity at any time during an income year has an amount of excess franking offsets for that year if: 
(a) the total amount of tax offsets to which the entity is entitled for that year under Division 207 and Subdivision 210-H (except those that are subject to the refundable tax offset rules because of section 67-25); 
exceeds: 
(b) the amount of income tax that the entity would have to pay on its taxable income for that year if:
(i) it did not have those tax offsets; and 
(ii) it did not have any tax offsets that are subject to the tax offset carry forward rules or the refundable tax offset rules; and 
(iii) it did not have any tax offset under section 205-70; 
but had all its other tax offsets.   
The excess is the amount of excess franking offsets.
Example:
For the 2002-2003 income year, Company E has: 
- assessable income of $200 (franked distribution of $140 and franking credit of $60); and 
- $100 of deductions that are allowable. 
The tax offset of $60 from the franking credit is not stated in Division 67 to be subject to the refundable tax offset rules. 
Disregarding the tax offset of $60 from the franking credit, the amount of income tax that Company E would have to pay is $30: 
[($140 + $60) - $100] x 30% 
This amount is $30 less than the tax offset of $60. Company E therefore has an amount of excess franking offsets of $30 for that year.</link:label>
