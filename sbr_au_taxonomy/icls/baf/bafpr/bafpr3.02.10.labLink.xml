- The change in net market value of unit-linked insurance or investment policies; and
- The change in net market value of policies in respect of death, total, permanent or temporary disablement.
Important:
If the superannuation entity invests in statutory funds of a life insurer and does not know the realised gains and losses, the superannuation entity should only account for the total change in net market value. An estimate can be provided to calculate realised and unrealised gains and losses on a pro rata basis.

Unrealised gains/losses:
The change in the net market value is the increase or decrease in the market value of each asset compared to the value of that asset at the beginning of the reporting period. These assets are still owned by the entity at the end of the period, they have not been disposed of, and as a result, the gains or losses on the assets are unrealised. If the assets are disposed of during the period, then the gains or losses are realised.
Only include the movement in the net market value of the asset. Do not include the movement in the value of the currency relative to the Australian dollar (AUD) if the asset is denominated in a currency other than the AUD.</link:label>
