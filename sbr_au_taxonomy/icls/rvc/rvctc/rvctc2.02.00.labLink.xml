The fund can deduct an amount where it increases (or does not reduce) a superannuation lump sum death benefit so that the death benefit amount is not reduced because of the tax on contributions (the 'tax saving amount'). The lump sum payment must be made to the trustee of the deceased's estate or to the deceased's dependant (an individual who was a spouse, former spouse or child of the deceased) at the time of death or payment in order to claim the deduction. The deduction is only available to the extent that the spouse, former spouse or child of the deceased can reasonably be expected to benefit from the estate.  The amount of the deduction is calculated by dividing the tax saving amount by the low tax component rate (which is generally 15%).</link:label>

It can be one of the following:
* A lump sum paid to an employee by an employer when they retired or ceased employment, such as:
- a payment in lieu of notice or a 'golden handshake'
- a payment for unused sick leave or unused rostered days off
- compensation for loss of a job or wrongful dismissal
- a bona fide redundancy payment or an approved early retirement scheme payment that exceeded the tax-free threshold for such payments - currently $6,194 plus $3,097 for each complete year of service
- a payment received because of invalidity.
* A lump sum payment from a superannuation fund, approved deposit fund, retirement savings account or life assurance company, such as:
- payments received when a superannuation pension or annuity was changed into a lump sum
- payments received when a taxpayer made a withdrawal from an approved deposit fund
- other payments from a superannuation fund, excluding a pension or annuity or a departing Australia superannuation payment.
* A similar payment to those above, paid to the employee as the beneficiary of a person who has died. This is called a 'death benefit TP'. If the payments were made to the employee as the trustee of a deceased estate they must be shown in a trust tax return, not on the personal tax return. 
* A payment from the Tax Office of amounts collected from an employer under the Superannuation Guarantee or paid to the Superannuation Holding Accounts Special Account.</link:label>
