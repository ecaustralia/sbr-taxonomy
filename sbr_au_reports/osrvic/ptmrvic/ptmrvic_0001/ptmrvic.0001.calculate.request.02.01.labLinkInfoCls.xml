- provides essentially labour services; and 
- works exclusively or primarily for one principal. 
The provisions relating to contractors deem such contractors to be `employees` and deem payments made to them to be wages. The term `contractors` is a generic one, and includes sub-contractors, consultants, outworkers and so on. The provisions apply regardless of whether the contractor provides services through a company, trust, partnership or as a sole trader.

Exemptions
In practical terms, the contractor provisions initially capture all contracts for the performance of work. However, the provisions contain six exemptions, and if any one of the exemptions applies to a particular contract, the payments under that contract will not be taxable. The six contractor exemptions are:
- the contractor provides services to the principal on no more than 90 days in the financial year; 
- the contractor engages other labour to perform work under the contract; 
- the provision of labour is ancillary to the provision of materials and equipment under the contract; 
- the services provided by the contractor are not ordinarily required by the principal and the contractor ordinarily renders such services to the public generally; 
- the services are of a kind ordinarily required by the principal on less than 180 days in the financial year; and 
- the contractor ordinarily renders services of that type to the public generally in that financial year. 

Non Taxable Payments
In addition, payments to the following classes of contractors are not taxable even if none of the six exemptions applies:
- owner-drivers; 
- insurance agents; and 
- door-to-door sellers.                                                                                                                                                                           Further SRO References on the SRO web site, see also Rulings GEN.001,

Bonuses are usually paid as an incentive or reward for extra or outstanding service. Bonuses are always taxable. 
Expatriates, who have worked in Victoria, may receive bonuses overseas paid by an overseas parent company. Bonuses received overseas (often as a result of the company's or group's performance) are subject to payroll tax to the extent that they relate to a period in which the expatriate worked in Victoria.

Commissions - Commissions are generally payments based on achievement and are usually calculated on a percentage basis. 
Commissions paid to employees are always taxable, whether they are the sole method of remuneration or are paid in addition to a basic wage or retainer.

These include:
* a payment made in consequence of the retirement from, or termination of, any office or employment of an employee. This includes;

(i)  unused annual leave and long service leave payments;
(ii)  employment termination payments, within the meaning of section 82-130 of the Income Tax assessment Act 1997 (ITAA), that would be included in the assessable income of an employee under Part 2-40 of the ITAA;
transitional termination payments, within the meaning of section 82-10 of the Income tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997 and any payment that would be an employment termination payment but for the fact that it was received more than 12 months after termination;

* amounts paid or payable by a company as a consequence of terminating the services or office of
   a director;
* amounts paid or payable by a person taken to be an employer under the contractor provisions as a
  consequence of termination of the supply of services by a person taken to be an employee under those provisions.

Unused annual leave and long service leave
All unused (accrued) annual leave and long service leave paid to an employee upon termination of the employee's services (including a bonus, loading or other additional payment relating to that leave) is subject to payroll tax.

Unused sick leave paid upon termination of employment forms part of an employment termination payment and is considered in the following section.

Employment  Termination Payments
Employment termination payments may include:

*  payments for unused sick leave or rostered days off
*  payments in lieu of notice
*  ex gratia payments or 'golden handshakes'
*  an employee's invalidity payment (a permanent disability, other than compensation for personal injury), and
*  certain payments after the death of an employee.

Genuine redundancy payments and early retirement scheme payments 
A payment arising from the termination of employment may constitute either a genuine redundancy payment
under section 83-175 of the ITAA or an early retirement scheme payment under section 83-180 of the ITAA. Such payments are exempt from payroll tax to the extent that they are exempt from income tax.

However, from 1 July 2007 the value of an employer's contribution to any grant of a share or option to an employee or deemed employee, a director or former director, member (or former member) of the governing body of the company is subject to payroll tax.

The granting of a share or an option occurs if a person acquires a share or (in the case of an option), a right to the share. A value of the share or option becomes liable on the "relevant day". The employer can elect to treat the relevant day as either the date that the share or option is granted to the employee, or the "vesting date".

The vesting date for a share is the date when any conditions applying to granting the share have been met and the employee's legal or beneficial interest in the share cannot be rescinded. The vesting date for an option is the earlier of either one of two dates:

* when the share to which the option relates is granted to the employee, or
* when the right under the option to have the relevant share transferred, allotted or vested is exercised by the employee.

If the grant of a share or option constitutes wages, the amount of the wages is the market value of the share or option on the relevant day, less the consideration (if any) paid or given by the employee for the grant (excluding consideration in the form of services rendered), as determined in accordance with the Commonwealth income tax provisions.

The employer may reduce the taxable wages declared by the value of any previously declared share or option value, if the grant of a share or option was rescinded because the vesting conditions have not been met. However, this reduction in the taxable wages would not apply in circumstances where the employee decided not to exercise the option.

If the grant of a share or option is withdrawn, cancelled or exchanged before the vesting date for some valuable consideration other than a share or option, the date on which that occurs is deemed to be the vesting date and the taxable amount is taken to be the value of the consideration.

It is sometimes necessary to determine the correct jurisdiction for payroll tax liability in the case of employment in multiple jurisdictions. In respect of shares or options, the payment is deemed to be in the state or territory of registration or incorporation of the company in which the share or option is granted.

The granting of a share or option, which is classified as a fringe benefit under the FBT Act is not treated as a fringe benefit, but rather as wages for payroll tax purposes.

Shares/Options Offset

Employers are able to offset the value of any over declared shares or options from a previous financial year by under-declaring the value in the current financial year. It should be noted that the Shares/Options field can only take positive amounts, so if the ultimate figure is negative then the Salaries/Wages field will need to be reduced by the over-declared amount and provide  offset figures in the comments field on the declaration page.

This scenario may result where shares or options are granted to an employee that may have certain conditions attached to them that the employee needs to meet in order to have the shares or options allocated to them, such as performance targets. If the employee does not meet the criteria and the employer has declared the taxable value at the granting date, the employer will need to offset the over-declared amount, rather than seeking a refund.

However, no reduction is available if options expire merely because they were not exercised by the relevant date or because the person fails to exercise his/her rights in respect of a share or option.

This is on the basis that both periods are twelve months. 

Victorian Component Determination
If you are unable to accurately determine the Victorian component of your fringe benefits, you can declare the amount based on the proportion of your total Victorian wages (excluding fringe benefits) to your total Australian wages (excluding fringe benefits).
