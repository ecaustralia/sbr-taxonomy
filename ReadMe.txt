---------------- 1. Introduction -----------------

The SBR AU Taxonomy is comprised of two major parts: The SBR AU Taxonomy (Definitional) and SBR AU Reporting taxonomies.

The SBR AU Taxonomy provides you with common harmonised definitions of data elements. The SBR AU Reporting taxonomies reference elements in the SBR AU Taxonomy (Definitional) and define the reports you can exchange with participating government agencies.

For the full list of reports in scope for SBR please refer to the SBR web site (www.sbr.gov.au) under the 'Software Developers' page. 

The SBR AU Taxonomy Architecture document contains details to assist you with understanding and using the SBR AU Taxonomy (Definitional) and SBR AU Reporting taxonomies. This document can be located under the 'Common components' section, within 'downloads' on the 'Software Developers' page on the SBR web site.
