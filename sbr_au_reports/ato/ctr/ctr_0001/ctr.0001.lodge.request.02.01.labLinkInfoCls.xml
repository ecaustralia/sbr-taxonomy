If the answer is in the affirmative please answer the additional question: Did this CGT event relate to a forestry managed investment scheme interest that you held other than as an initial participant?

CGT events are the different types of transactions or events that may result in a capital gain or capital loss. Many CGT events involve a CGT asset - for example, the disposal of a CGT asset - while other CGT events relate directly to capital receipts (capital proceeds). An Australian resident company makes a capital gain or capital loss if a CGT event happens to any of its worldwide CGT assets. A company that is not an Australian resident company makes a capital gain or capital loss, generally speaking, if a CGT event happens to any of its CGT assets which have the necessary connection with Australia just before the CGT event happens. If the company ceases to hold or to use a depreciating asset that was used for both taxable and non-taxable purposes, a CGT event may happen to the asset. A capital gain or capital loss may arise to the extent that the asset was used for a non-taxable purpose. For more information about CGT events, see the ATO website. The Guide to capital gains tax includes:

- a capital gain or capital loss worksheet for calculating a capital gain or capital loss for each CGT event
- a CGT summary worksheet for calculating the company's net capital gain or capital loss
- a CGT schedule.

Completion of the worksheets is not mandatory. Do not attach them to the company tax return - keep them with the company's tax records. However, if the company has:
- total current year capital gains are greater than $10,000, or
- total current year capital losses are year greater than $10,000
complete a CGT schedule and attach it to the company tax return</link:label>

Any company that is a subsidiary member of a consolidated group at the end of the income year is not required to complete Losses Information item. 
Other companies, including the head company of a consolidated group at the end of the income year, may need to complete Losses Information item.

Net exempt income (if any) must be taken into account in calculating the amount of tax losses carried forward to the 2008-09 income year - see sections 36-10 and 36-17 of the ITAA 1997.

Tax losses carried forward may be affected by the commercial debt forgiveness provisions. 

Under sections 36-17 and 36-55 of the ITAA 1997 a company is:
- subject to certain limitations, able to choose the amount of prior year tax losses it wishes to deduct in a later year of income from the excess (if any) of its assessable income over total deductions (other than tax losses).
Providing choice means that companies can choose not to deduct prior year losses in order to pay sufficient tax to be able to frank their distributions
- able, in certain circumstances, to convert excess franking offsets into a tax loss for the income year and carry forward the tax loss for consideration as a deduction in a later income year.

If the company has excess franking offsets at  Excess franking offsets , calculate the company's tax loss for the income year under the method statement in subsection 36-55(2) of the ITAA 1997 as follows:
Step 1. Work out the amount (if any) that would have been the company's tax loss for the year under section 36-10, 165-70, 175-35 or 701-30 of the ITAA 1997, disregarding any net exempt income.
Step 2. Divide the amount of excess franking offsets by the corporate tax rate.
Step 3. Add the result of steps 1 and 2.
Step 4. Take away the company's net exempt income (if any).
The result (if a positive amount) is the company's tax loss for the income year. Include this amount in this field with any unapplied prior year(s) tax loss(es).

If a company is required to complete a Losses schedule, the amount of the tax losses carried forward to later income years in part A of that schedule must be the same as the amount shown in this field.

Do not include any net capital losses to be carried forward to later income years - inform  these separately at Net capital losses carried forward to later income years and in the CGT schedule, if a CGT schedule is required.

If a head company is required to complete a Consolidated groups losses schedule, the amount of the tax losses shown at  Tax losses carried forward to later income years in part A of that schedule must also be the same as the amount shown in this field.

If the company is a subsidiary member of a consolidated group at the end of the income year, this field is not applicable.</link:label>

For Companies that are not an eligible small business entity that has chosen to use the simplified depreciation rules, this is the book depreciation expenses for depreciating assets. This amount does not include profit on sale of depreciating assets or loss on sale of depreciating assets. If the Company is an eligible small business entity and has chosen to use the simplified depreciation rules, this is the total depreciation deductions being claimed under the simplified depreciation rules and the uniform capital allowances (UCA) rules. Small business entities can claim an immediate deduction for most depreciating assets costing less than $1,000 each (excluding input tax credit entitlements) and pool most of their other depreciating assets.

There are aggregation rules to help you determine who is an affiliate and when an entity is connected with you for the purpose of calculating your aggregated turnover. Certain transactions, such as income from dealings between the company and any entities that it is connected with or that are its affiliates, are excluded from aggregated turnover.
If a partnership is connected with the company, it is the company's turnover combined with the partnership's turnover that is relevant in determining the company's eligibility for the ETO in relation to its small business income. Correspondingly, it is the turnover of the partnership combined with the company's turnover that is relevant in determining the company's eligibility for the ETO in relation to its share of the partnership's net small business income.
If the company is not affiliated or connected with any other entities under the aggregation rules, the company's aggregated turnover will be equal to its annual business turnover.
If the company is claiming a tax offset in respect of a share of net small business income received from a partnership or trust, inform "D" in the aggregated turnover of the partnership or trust. You will need to obtain the partnership's and/or trust's aggregated turnover and your share of the net small business income from the preparer of the partnership's and/or trust's tax return.

In most cases, the company's small business entity turnover amount will be the same as its aggregated turnover. However, if any of the following circumstances apply the company will need to make the following adjustments to calculate the small business entity turnover.
-  If another entity's turnover has been included  in the company's aggregated turnover amount, then that entity's turnover must be excluded, and  add back any income the company derived from its affiliates or connected entities.
- If the company operated a business for part of the year, include only the company's actual turnover amount. There is no need to use the estimate of its full year turnover.
- If the company had retail fuel sales, add back those sales.
If the aggregated turnover in relation to an amount of net small business income is greater than or equal to $75,000, do not complete this item as the company is not entitled to an ETO in respect of that net small business income amount.</link:label>

There are two methods to account for bad debt:
Direct write off method (Non - GAAP) - A receivable which is not considered collectible is charged directly to the income statement.
Allowance method (GAAP) - An estimate is made at the end of each fiscal year of the amount of bad debt. This is then accumulated in a provision which is then used to reduce specific receivable accounts as and when necessary.
Include recovery of bad debts at Other gross income. A deduction for bad debts is not allowable unless the debt that is bad has previously been included in assessable income, or is for money lent in the ordinary course of the business of lending money by a company carrying on that business.
Do not include accounting provisions for doubtful debts at this field, but at all other expenses and add them back at Non-deductible expenses.
Before a bad debt can be claimed, it must be bad and not merely doubtful. The deduction depends on the facts in each case and, where applicable, the action taken for recovery.
A deduction can also be claimed for:
- partial debt write-offs where only part of a debt is bad and is written off
- losses incurred in debt and equity swaps for debt extinguished after 26 February 1992 if the legal provisions are satisfied. Under these provisions, a deduction may be allowable for the difference between the amount of the debt extinguished and the greater of the market value of the equity or the value at which the equity is recorded in the creditor's books at the time of issue. The market value of the equity is the price quoted on the stock exchange or, if the equity is not listed, the net asset backing of the equity.
If the taxpayer is not in the business of lending money, the deduction is limited to the amount of the debt included in assessable income.
A deduction for a bad debt or loss on a debt and equity swap is only allowable if the company claiming the deduction satisfies:
- a continuity of ownership test (or we consider it unreasonable to have to satisfy the test), or
- the same business test (if the continuity of ownership test is not satisfied or it is not practicable to show that it is).
Where a debt was incurred in an income year prior to that in which it is written off as bad, the company must satisfy the continuity of ownership test at all times from the date on which the debt was incurred through to the end of the income year in which it writes off the debt.
Where a debt was both incurred and written off as bad in the same income year, the company must satisfy the continuity of ownership test at all times during that income year. A company cannot deduct a debt that is both incurred and written off as bad on the last day of the income year.
Deductions for bad debts may also be reduced by the commercial debt forgiveness provisions.
Special rules apply to determine if the head company of a consolidated or MEC group can deduct a bad debt that for a period has been owed to a member of a consolidated or MEC group and for another period has been owed to an entity that was not a member of that group.</link:label>

Step 1. Work out the company's taxable income for the year.
Step 2. Work out 25% of the basic income tax liability on that taxable income.
Step 3. Work out the small business percentage of the taxable income using the following formula:
[the company's net small business income  for the year * 100 / the company's taxable income for the year]
If the percentage that results is more than 100%, the small business percentage is 100%.
Step 4. If the aggregated turnover is $50,000 or less, the tax offset is the step 2 amount multiplied by the small business percentage.
Step 5 If the aggregated turnover is more than $50,000, work out the small business phase-out fraction using this formula:
[$75,000 - the aggregated turnover for the year / $25,000]
The tax offset in these circumstances is:
[step 2 amount * small business percentage * small business phase-out fraction]

The entrepreneurs tax offset and PAYG:
The ETO is not taken into consideration when determining the rate of PAYG instalments.
If an entity anticipates that it will be entitled to the tax offset on assessment, the entity may vary its instalments during the year. However, the entity may be liable to the general interest charge where a variation results in an underestimation of the instalments of more than 15%.</link:label>

An entity that is a corporate tax entity at any time during an income year has an amount of excess franking offsets for that year if: 
(a) the total amount of tax offsets to which the entity is entitled for that year under Division 207 and Subdivision 210-H (except those that are subject to the refundable tax offset rules because of section 67-25); 
exceeds: 
(b) the amount of income tax that the entity would have to pay on its taxable income for that year if:
(i) it did not have those tax offsets; and 
(ii) it did not have any tax offsets that are subject to the tax offset carry forward rules or the refundable tax offset rules; and 
(iii) it did not have any tax offset under section 205-70; 
but had all its other tax offsets.   
The excess is the amount of excess franking offsets.
Example:
For the 2002-2003 income year, Company E has: 
- assessable income of $200 (franked distribution of $140 and franking credit of $60); and 
- $100 of deductions that are allowable. 
The tax offset of $60 from the franking credit is not stated in Division 67 to be subject to the refundable tax offset rules. 
Disregarding the tax offset of $60 from the franking credit, the amount of income tax that Company E would have to pay is $30: 
[($140 + $60) - $100] x 30% 
This amount is $30 less than the tax offset of $60. Company E therefore has an amount of excess franking offsets of $30 for that year.</link:label>

Can claim a deduction for the decline in value of a water facility in equal instalments over three years.
The Company's total deductions for landcare operation expenses and for the decline in value of water facilities. The Company can claim a deduction in the year it incurs capital expenditure on a landcare operation for land in Australia. Unless the Company is a rural land irrigation water provider, the deduction is available to the extent the Company uses the land for either a primary production business, or in the case of rural land, carrying on a business for a taxable purpose from the use of that land - except a business of mining or quarrying. The Company may claim the deduction even if it is only a lessee of the land. The deduction is also available to rural land irrigation water providers - that is, to entities whose business is primarily and principally the supply of water (other than by using a motor vehicle) to entities for use in primary production businesses on land in Australia or to businesses (other than mining or quarrying businesses) using rural land in Australia. If the Company is a rural land irrigation water provider, it can claim a deduction for capital expenditure it incurs on a landcare operation for land in Australia that other entities - being entities supplied with water by the company - use at the time for carrying on primary production businesses, or rural land in Australia that other entities - being entities supplied with water by the company - use at the time for carrying on businesses for a taxable purpose from the use of that land (except a business of mining or quarrying). A rural land irrigation water provider's deduction is reduced by a reasonable amount to reflect an entity's use of the land for other than a taxable purpose after the water provider incurred the expenditure. A deduction cannot be claimed if the capital expenditure is on plant unless it is on certain fences, dams or other structural improvements. The Company can claim a deduction for the decline in value of a water facility in equal instalments over three years. A water facility is plant or a structural improvement that is primarily or principally for the purpose of conserving or conveying water, or a structural improvement that is reasonably incidental to conserving or conveying water. It also includes a repair of a capital nature, or an alteration, addition or extension, to that plant or structural improvement. Unless the Company is an irrigation water provider, the expenditure must be incurred by the company primarily and principally for conserving or conveying water for use in its primary production business on land in Australia. The Company may claim the deduction even if it is only a lessee of the land. The deduction is reduced if the facility is not wholly used for either carrying on a primary production business on land in Australia, or a taxable purpose. The deduction for water facilities is also available to irrigation water providers - that is, to entities whose business is primarily and principally the supply (other than by using a motor vehicle) of water to other entities for use in a primary production business on land in Australia. If the company is an irrigation water provider, it must incur the expenditure on the water facility primarily and principally for conserving or conveying water for use in primary production businesses conducted by other entities on land in Australia - being entities supplied with water by the Company. The Company's deduction is reduced if the water facility is not wholly used for a taxable purpose.</link:label>

A Company may have a landcare or water facility tax offset carried forward to this income year if its income tax liabilities and net exempt income for earlier years did not absorb all of the tax offset available to it from a previous year. This label shows the total of any landcare and water facility tax offsets carried forward and available for offset in this income year. A Company must first apply a carried forward tax offset to reduce any unused net exempt income to nil for this year or for any earlier income year in which the Company had a taxable income after the year in which the tax offset arose. Net exempt income is reduced by $1 for each 30 cents of the tax offset. The Company cannot apply a tax offset it has carried forward if Subdivision 165-A of the ITAA 1997 (about the consequences of changing ownership or control of a Company on deducting tax losses of earlier income years) would prevent the Company from deducting a tax loss for the current year. The company can claim a deduction for the decline in value of a water facility in equal instalments over three years.</link:label>

Membership-based non-profit organisations (including licensed clubs) are only assessable on trading income that relates to non-members, on income received from sources outside its trading activities (including commercial transactions with members) and on revenue specified as income by tax law. This is due to the principle of mutuality that recognises that any surplus arising from contributions to a common fund created and controlled by people for a common purpose is not income. Mutual receipts of non-profit companies, however, are classified under tax law as non-assessable, non-exempt income.</link:label>

Employers are entitled to a deduction for contributions made to a complying superannuation, provident, benefit or retirement fund, or retirement savings account (RSA), if the contribution is to provide superannuation benefits for employees or to provide benefits to an employee's dependants on the employee's death. Superannuation benefits mean payments for superannuation member benefits or superannuation death benefits.
A deduction is allowable in the income year in which the contributions are made. There is no limit on the amount of contributions that can be claimed as a deduction by an employer contributing to a complying superannuation fund or RSA for employees under the age of 75 years. However, the employee may be subject to excess concessional contributions tax at the rate of 31.5% on excess concessional contributions if their concessional contributions in a financial year exceed the concessional contributions cap of $50,000.A transitional arrangement allows a higher cap of $100,000on concessional contributions for the 2007-08 to 2011-12 financial years for individuals aged 50 years or over on the last day of the financial year. If an employee has reached the age of 75 years, there is a restriction on the deduction that can be claimed for an employer contribution to a complying superannuation fund or RSA. For contributions made after the 28th day of the month following the employee's 75th birthday, the deduction claimable is limited to the amount of the contribution required under an industry award, determination or notional agreement preserving state awards. The adjustments for taxation purposes are included at W Non-deductible expenses item 7. No deduction is allowable if the fund is a non-complying fund.In addition, contributions made to a non-complying fund do not count towards superannuation guarantee obligations. The superannuation guarantee charge is payable on the superannuation guarantee shortfall. As such, it is neither a superannuation contribution nor tax deductible. Contributions made by employers to be offset against a superannuation guarantee charge liability are not deductible. Contributions paid by an employer for employees to a non-complying superannuation fund may be fringe benefits and, as such, may be subject to tax under the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986.

The amount of tax losses transferred to the company from group companies under Subdivision 170-A of the ITAA 1997. A group company may transfer the whole or part of a tax loss to another company where:
- both companies are members of the same wholly owned group, and
- one of the companies is - an Australian branch of a foreign bank, or - an Australian PE of a foreign financial entity if the tax loss is for an income year commencing on or after June 2005, and

The tax loss transferred to the income company is deductible to the income company in accordance with the provisions of the section 36-17 of the ITAA 1997. For example, the tax loss transferred to the income company is first offset against the income company's net exempt income, then against its assessable income.
- Tax losses transferred cannot be used to create a tax loss.
- The Commissioner has power in certain circumstances to amend assessments to disallow a deduction for an amount of transferred tax loss despite section 170 - see section 170-70 of the ITAA 1997. Consolidated groups tax losses cannot be transferred to a head company from subsidiary companies under Subdivision 170-A if the ITAA 1997 when consolidation occurs part way through the head company's income year.

Under Division 7A of Part III of the ITAA 1936, payments,  loans and debts forgiven - unless they come within specified exclusion - by a private company to a shareholder or associates of a shareholder are treated as assessable dividends to the extent of the private company's distributable surplus as defined in Division 7A.
A payment made in the income year by a private company to a shareholder (or associate of a shareholder) can be converted into a loan before the end of the private company's lodgment day that is defined to be the earlier of the due date for lodgment or the date of lodgment of the company's income tax return for the year in which the loan is made.
Loans, and payments converted to loans in the income year, made by a private company to a shareholder (or associate of a shareholder) that are not repaid, may be put on a commercial footing before the private company's lodgment day. This will prevent the loan from being treated
as a deemed dividend.
Do not include a dividend paid under a demerger at this label unless the head entity of the demerger group has elected under subsection 44(2) of the ITAA 1936 that it be treated as an assessable dividend.</link:label>

The following items are shown here:
- The excess of the company's foreign source income and attributed foreign income for taxation purposes over income from such sources shown in the accounts. Gross up foreign source income by the amount of foreign tax paid. Include any add-back or subtraction adjustment to expenses claimed against such income separately at Non-deductible expenses or at Other deductible expense.
- Assessable foreign exchange gains to the extent that they have not been included at Calculation of total profit or loss, or at any other label of Reconciliation to taxable income or loss. See Foreign exchange gains and losses on the ATO website for more information.
- Assessable balancing adjustment amounts for non-R&amp;D assets. (Assessable balancing adjustment amounts for assets used in R&amp;D activities subject to the R&amp;D tax concession are taken into account at L Australian owned R&amp;D tax concession - not including Australian owned R&amp;D - extra incremental 50% deduction.)
Note: Assessable balancing adjustment amounts for assets
used in foreign-owned R&amp;D activities are not subject to
the R&amp;D tax concession and should not be included
in Accounting expenditure in 'Calculation of total profit t or loss' subject to R&amp;D tax concession, Australian owned R&amp;D tax concession - not including 'Australian owned R&amp;D - extra incremental 50% deduction', or Foreign owned R&amp;D tax concession - not including 'Foreign owned R&amp;D - extra incremental 75% deduction'.
If the company ceases to hold or to use a depreciating
asset, a balancing adjustment event occurs. For
assets subject to the small business entity depreciation
rules, see the ATO website Step 5 of Disposal of depreciating assets. For assets not subject to the small business entity depreciation rules, calculate a balancing adjustment amount to include in the company's
assessable income or to claim as a deduction.
If the asset was used for both taxable and non-taxable
purposes, reduce the balancing adjustment amount by
the amount attributable to the non-taxable use. A capital
gain or capital loss amount may arise attributable to that
non-taxable use. For more information, see the ATO website Guide to
depreciating assets.

The total of the Company's deductions allowable for eligible business related capital expenditure it incurred that is not otherwise deductible or taken into account, and for which a deduction is not denied by some other provision. Taxpayer's are provided a five-year write-off for certain business related capital expenditure incurred in relation to a past, present or proposed business. The deduction applies to business-related capital expenditure incurred after 30 June 2005. Generally, the expenditure is only deductible to the extent the business is, was or is proposed to be carried on for a taxable purpose. A deduction cannot be claimed for capital expenditure to the extent that it:
- can be deducted under another provision of the income tax laws
- forms part of the cost of a depreciating asset the Company holds, used to hold or will hold
- forms part of the cost of land
- relates to a lease or other legal or equitable right
- would be taken into account in working out an assessable profit or deductible loss
- could be taken into account in working out a capital gain or a capital loss from a CGT event
- would be specifically not deductible under the income tax laws if the expenditure was not capital expenditure
- is specifically not deductible under the income tax laws for a reason other than that the expenditure is capital expenditure
- is of a private or domestic nature
- is incurred in relation to gaining or producing exempt income or non-assessable non-exempt income
- is excluded from the cost or cost base of an asset because, under special rules in the UCA or capital gains tax regimes respectively, the cost or cost base of the asset was taken to be the market value, or
- is a return of or on capital (for example, distributions by trustees) or a return of a non-assessable amount (for example, repayments of loan principal).
The Company deducts 20% of the qualifying capital expenditure in the year it is incurred and in each of the following four years.</link:label>

Enter all assessable income less deductions that equals the amount at this field 'Total profit or loss' plus or minus the reconciliation adjustments plus the amount shown at 'R&amp;D tax offset, if chosen'. If the company has a taxable income of $1 or more, transfer the amount at 'Taxable income or loss' to 'Taxable or net income' in the calculation statement. The company's tax loss at 'Taxable income or loss' is the excess of its total deductions (except tax losses for earlier income years) over its total assessable income and net exempt income - see section 36-10 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. If the amount is a loss, ensure it is represented as a negative number. The company's net exempt income is calculated under section 36-20 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and is not necessarily equal to the amount written at 'Exempt income'. Check that the amount at 'Other assessable income' includes the amount of net exempt income taken into account in calculating the company's tax loss. If the company has a tax loss at this label, print zero (0) at 'Taxable or net income' in the 'Calculation statement'. If the company has excess franking offsets that can be converted under section 36-55 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 into a tax loss to be carried forward, do not include at this field the amount of that tax loss. However, that amount should be taken into account in calculating the company's tax loss at 'Tax losses carried forward to later income years'. This means that a company may have a taxable income at 'Taxable income or loss' and a tax loss carried forward.  Alternatively, if the company's total deductions exceed total assessable income and net exempt income, it would show an amount at this field that, disregarding section 36-55, would have been its tax loss for the income year.</link:label>

The net amount of commercial debts forgiven must be applied to reduce the company's deductible revenue losses, net capital losses, certain undeducted revenue or capital expenditure and the cost base of certain CGT assets, in that order.
Calculate the net forgiven amount as follows:
1. Determine the notional value of the debt. In the general case, this is the lesser of
-the value of the debt at the time of forgiveness (assuming the company was solvent at that time and the time the debt was incurred), and
- the value of the debt at the time of forgiveness (assuming solvency as above and no changes in market variables) plus any amounts that are allowable as deductions as a result of the debt forgiveness and that are attributable to market movements that occurred while the debt was held. Special rules apply in calculating the notional value of non-recourse debt and in respect of debt parking circumstances. 
2. Calculate the gross forgiven amount of the debt by deducting from the notional value of the debt any amount of consideration provided in respect of the forgiveness.  This consideration normally is the sum of the amounts of money the company is required to pay in respect of the forgiveness or, if property is required to be given, the market value of the property. Special rules apply in determining the consideration given for the forgiveness if a debt is forgiven in exchange for shares, if there are debt parking circumstances, or if money or property is applied for the benefit or at the direction of the creditor - see sections 245-65 and 245-70 of Schedule 2C to the ITAA 1936.</link:label>

If there is a deficit balance in the franking account at the end of the income year, the company must lodge a Franking account tax return and pay Franking Deficit Tax(FDT) by the last day of the month following the end of the income year. If the company is a late balancing company that has elected to have its FDT liability determined on 30 June of financial year, it must lodge its franking account tax return on or before 31 July of financial year.
If the company is a Pooled Development Fund (PDF) and its venture capital sub-account is in deficit at the end of the PDF's income year or immediately before it ceases to be a PDF, the company is liable to pay venture capital deficit tax. If the PDF has a liability to venture capital deficit tax, a Venture capital deficit tax return must be lodged.

Note:
- Shareholder loans and other advances made by private companies that are deemed dividends are not frankable unless a section in the ITAA 1936 or ITAA 1997 provides that the dividend can be franked. For example, where the Commissioner exercises a limited power to permit the deemed dividend to be franked, or where the deemed dividend is paid in connection with a relationship breakdown.
- Deemed dividends may also arise when a shareholder (or associate of such shareholder) of a private company that has (or will have by a certain time) an unpaid present entitlement from a trust estate receives a payment or loan or has a debt forgiven in their favour by the trustee of the trust estate. However, this will not result in a debit to the franking account of the private company with the unpaid present entitlement.
- A company determines whether its franking account needs adjustment, because the measures may affect imputation benefits available to shareholders, deny franking credits or give rise to additional franking debits. 
For more detailed information on the simplified imputation system, visit the ATO website.

If the company was a subsidiary member of a consolidated or MEC group at the end of the income year and is completing a tax return because of any non-membership periods, inform in this field its franking account balance as at the end of the latest non-membership period if it is a surplus balance. If there is a deficit balance at the end of any non-membership period, the company must lodge a franking account tax return and pay the FDT.</link:label>

Under Division 7A of Part III of the ITAA 1936, loans by a private company to a shareholder or associates of a shareholder - unless they come within specified exclusions - are treated as assessable dividends to the extent of the distributable surplus including realised and unrealised profit. Advances or loans to shareholders or associates may represent a distribution of profits and may be assessed to the recipient as unfranked dividends.
A loan made in the income year by a private company to a shareholder (or associate of a shareholder) may be repaid or put on a commercial footing, before the earlier of the due date for lodgment or the date of lodgment of the private company's income tax return for the year in which the loan is made, in order to prevent the loan from being treated as a deemed dividend.</link:label>

The net small business income is the entity's small business entity turnover less the allowable deductions attributable to that turnover. There must be an amount of net small business income included in the company's assessable income before an entitlement to the tax offset arises.
The deductions attributable to the small business entity turnover are the allowable deductions that the entity can claim against its assessable income which specifically relate to that turnover.
Note:
When determining the allowable deductions attributable to an entity's small business entity turnover for the purposes of working out the net small business income:
1. Do not include
- tax losses from prior years
- gifts or donations, or
- costs of managing your tax affairs.
2.  Use a reasonable basis to apportion any small business pool deduction if the pool includes assets that are used partly for business and partly for other income-producing activities.
Do not complete this item if there is no amount of net small business income or the allowable deductions exceed the small business entity turnover.</link:label>

Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) assessable income is the sum of:
- non-CGT assessable income derived from an SME investment or derived from the disposal of an SME investment at a time when the company was a PDF, and
- the overall capital gain allocated to the SME assessable income class.

The overall capital gain allocated to the SME assessable income class is the amount of any ordinary capital gain that would otherwise arise from a Capital Gain Tax (CGT) event at a time the company was a Pooled Development Fund (PDF) in relation to an SME investment less: 
- any ordinary capital loss for that class, and
- any overall capital loss from another class of assessable income, and then
- any prior year net capital losses.
Capital gains in one class of assessable income are first reduced by capital losses in that class and then by capital losses in another class. Prior year capital losses are applied first against capital gains in the SME assessable income class.

Full-year PDF
For a company that is a PDF for the full income year, the SME income component is SME assessable income less deductions allowable to the PDF for the income year.

Part-year PDF
A company that becomes a PDF part way through the income year and is still a PDF at the end of the income year is taxed as a PDF from the day it became registered as a PDF to the end of the income year as if that period were an income year ('the PDF period'). The PDF component is
the taxable income for the PDF period. (A company's 'PDF component' is its 'adjusted taxable income'.)

The SME income component of a part-year PDF is the company's SME assessable income less any deductions allowable to the company for the income year that relate to the PDF period.</link:label>

- amounts of the intercorporate dividend rebate as this is no longer available
- any foreign tax credit 
- any FDT offset
- any R&amp;D tax offset

If the total of rebates/tax offsets is more than the amount at Gross tax, reduce the amount of this label so that it equals the amount at Gross Tax. The aggregate amount this label cannot exceed Gross tax.

The following tax offsets are subject to refundable tax offset rules:
- R&amp;D tax offset
- film tax offsets under Division 376 of the ITAA 1997
- franking tax offsets claimed by life insurance companies to the extent that they relate to distributions paid on shares and other membership interests held on behalf of policy holders
- franking credits claimed by endorsed income tax exempt charities and deductible gift recipients that are entitled to a refund of excess franking credits. These entities may complete the Application for refund of franking credits - Endorsed income tax exempt charities and deductible gift recipients rather than the company tax return to obtain a refund.
The company may have a refundable amount to the extent that the total of these tax offsets exceeds the tax that would otherwise be payable by the company after all its other tax offsets are taken into account.

- an additional tax deduction of 10% of the cost of eligible new tangible depreciating assets is available where the business
- commits to investing in the asset between 1 July 2009 and 31 December 2009 inclusive, and 
- first uses the asset, or installs it ready for use, or (in the case of new investment in an existing asset) brings the asset to its modified or improved state, on or before 31 December 2010.Generally, a business 'commits' to investing when:
- it enters into a contract under which the asset is held
- it starts to construct the asset, or n it starts to hold the asset in some other way.

The tax break applies to new tangible depreciating assets for which a deduction is available under Subdivision 40-B of the ITAA1997 and certain new investments in existing assets.</link:label>

The NRAS is designed to encourage large-scale investment in affordable housing. The NRAS offers incentives to providers of new dwellings on the condition that they are rented to low and moderate income households at 20% below market rates.
The refundable tax offset is only available where the Housing Secretary of the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs has issued a certificate under the NRAS. In order to claim the tax offset in the 2008-09 income year, the NRAS certificate must relate to the NRAS year comprising the period 1 July 2008 to 30 April 2009.
For more information, see National Rental Affordability Scheme - refundable tax offset and other taxation issues at www.ato.gov.au

Note: The NRAS tax offset is subject to the refundable tax offset rules and can be claimed at label "c"  Rebates/tax offsets in the Calculation statement. However, if the company has an excess of tax offsets subject to the refundable tax offset rules, the excess should be included at label "z" Other refundable credits in the Calculation statement.</link:label>

Zero amount  is acceptable.
Under the existing law, balancing adjustment amounts are not to be included in the calculation of PAYG instalment income. This amount will be one of a variety of things included in taxpayer's TOFA gains/losses reported at Item 7. As such it is necessary to separately identify this amount so as to ensure this amount is not included in the calculation of a taxpayer's PAYG instalment income. It will be possible to remove this label in Taxtime 2016 as the balancing adjustment provisions only apply to the first 4 years the Division 230 applies to a taxpayer. (A loss box is required next to this label, for taxpayers to advise if this is an overall loss amount.)</link:label>
