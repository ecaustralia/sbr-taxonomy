Ensure the name of the AMIT class is consistent with the class name used on the Trust Attribution Managed Investments schedule (TRTAMIS) for that class. Lodge a separate Capital Gains Tax (CGT) schedule for each AMIT class as required.
An ex-AMIT must not complete the multi-class AMIT fields of the CGT schedule. An ex-AMIT may complete one CGT schedule only with the Trust return.</link:label>
