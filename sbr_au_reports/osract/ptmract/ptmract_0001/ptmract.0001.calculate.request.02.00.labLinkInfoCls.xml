The payments are usually taxable where the contractor: 1) provides essentially labour services; and 2) works exclusively or primarily for one principal. The provisions relating to contractors deem such contractors to be employees and deem payments made to them to be wages. The term `contractors` is a generic one, and includes sub-contractors, consultants, outworkers and so on. The provisions apply regardless of whether the contractor provides services through a company, trust, partnership or as a sole trader. Exemptions: In practical terms, the contractor provisions initially capture all contracts for the performance of work. However, the provisions contain six exemptions, and if any one of the exemptions applies to a particular contract, the payments under that contract will not be taxable. The six contractor exemptions are 1) the contractor provides services to the principal on no more than 90 days in the financial year; 2) the contractor engages other labour to perform work under the contract;  3) the provision of labour is ancillary to the provision of materials and equipment under the contract; 4) the services provided by the contractor are not ordinarily required by the principal and the contractor ordinarily renders such services to the public generally; 5) the services are of a kind ordinarily required by the principal on less than 180 days in the financial year; and 6) the contractor ordinarily renders services of that type to the public generally in that financial year.  Non Taxable Payments: Payments to the following classes of contractors are not taxable even if none of the six exemptions applies: owner-drivers, insurance agents and door-to-door sellers</link:label>
