A type 1 aggregate applies if the employer  (or a member of the same
GST group) are entitled to a GST credit for goods or services
acquired in providing fringe benefits. GST affects the calculation of an employer's FBT liability. Where the benefit provider is entitled to a GST credit for goods or services acquired to provide fringe benefits, a higher gross-up rate (type 1) applies when calculating the FBT liability. The higher gross-up rate recovers the GST credit the benefit provider is entitled to.</link:label>
