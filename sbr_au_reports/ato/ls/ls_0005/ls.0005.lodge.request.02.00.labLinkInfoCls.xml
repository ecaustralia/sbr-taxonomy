Inform the relevant field with a zero (0)  if the company has an unrealised net gain at the changeover time. An unrealised net loss is, broadly, the excess of the company's  unrealised losses on assets over unrealised gains on assets at the changeover time. This is determined by deeming such assets to be disposed of at market value at the changeover time. A company may choose to exclude every asset that it acquired for less than $10,000 from the calculation of the amount. A company may also choose to use the written down value of depreciable plant - not a building or structure - at the changeover time rather than its market value at that time provided the expenditure incurred by the company to acquire the plant was less than $1 million, and it would be reasonable for the company to conclude that the market value of the plant at the changeover time was not less than 80% of its written down value at that time. The question whether a company has an unrealised net loss at a changeover time is calculated using the steps in the method statement.</link:label>
