These categories are used for capital adequacy purposes and are to be determined under the internal ratings-based supervisory slotting approach to credit risk, in accordance with relevant prudential standards.

Each slotting category is associated with a specific risk-weight for unexpected losses that broadly corresponds to a range of external credit assessments.</link:label>
