It can be one of the following:
* A lump sum paid to an employee by an employer when they retired or ceased employment, such as:
- a payment in lieu of notice or a 'golden handshake'
- a payment for unused sick leave or unused rostered days off
- compensation for loss of a job or wrongful dismissal
- a bona fide redundancy payment or an approved early retirement scheme payment that exceeded the tax-free threshold for such payments - currently $6,194 plus $3,097 for each complete year of service
- a payment received because of invalidity.
* A lump sum payment from a superannuation fund, approved deposit fund, retirement savings account or life assurance company, such as:
- payments received when a superannuation pension or annuity was changed into a lump sum
- payments received when a taxpayer made a withdrawal from an approved deposit fund
- other payments from a superannuation fund, excluding a pension or annuity or a departing Australia superannuation payment.
* A similar payment to those above, paid to the employee as the beneficiary of a person who has died. This is called a 'death benefit TP'. If the payments were made to the employee as the trustee of a deceased estate they must be shown in a trust tax return, not on the personal tax return. 
* A payment from the Tax Office of amounts collected from an employer under the Superannuation Guarantee or paid to the Superannuation Holding Accounts Special Account.</link:label>
