- With whom the individual was in a relationship that was registered under a prescribed state or territory law
- Who, although not legally married to the individual, lived with the individual on a genuine domestic basis in a relationship as a couple.
A child-housekeeper is the individual's child who keeps house full time. Child includes adopted child, stepchild, ex-nuptial child or child of the individual's spouse. However a child who is a full-time student or a full-time employee is not considered to keep house full time.
A housekeeper is a person who works full time keeping house for the individual and cares for:
 - a child aged under 21 years, irrespective of the child's adjusted taxable income (ATI)
 - any other child aged under 21 years who is a dependant and whose ATI is less than a specified limit
 - an invalid relative who is a dependant and for whom the individual can claim a dependent relative tax offset
 - a spouse who receives a disability support pension.</link:label>
