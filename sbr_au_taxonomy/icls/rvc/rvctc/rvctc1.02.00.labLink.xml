An entity is regarded as having received a bonus if it re-invests or otherwise deals with the bonus during the income year. It does not include the amount shown on a bonus certificate if the reporting entity: - received it because of death, accident, illness or other disability suffered by the person on whose life the policy was effected - received it under a policy held by a superannuation fund or scheme, an approved deposit fund or a pooled superannuation trust - can show that the amount was received because of serious financial difficulties, or - received a bonus certificate in respect of an amount allocated to increase the amount receivable on surrender or maturity. It does not include the amount of any bonus on a policy that has a date of commencement of risk on or before 7 December 1983. If the policy has a date of commencement of risk after 7 December 1983, the full amount of any bonus is included if received during the first eight years after the date of commencement of risk of the policy. Two-thirds of the bonus amount is included if it is received in the ninth year and one-third of the bonus amount if it is received in the 10th year. Amounts received after the 10th year are not included. If, during the term of the policy, the amount of a premium increases by more than 25% over the previous year's premium, the policy is taken to have started again with a commencement date at the beginning of the policy year in which the premium increased.</link:label>

- allowable franking tax offsets for the income year.
The amount claimed here should include the share of franking credit included in gross distributions from partnerships and gross distributions from trusts, the amount recorded at Franking credits and the amount recorded at Australian franking credits from a New Zealand company. If the shares or relevant interest are not held at risk as required under the holding period and related payments rules, or there is other manipulation of the imputation system, there is no entitlement to a franking tax offset
- tax offsets for bonuses and certain other amounts received under short-term life insurance policies taken out after 27 August 1982
- tax offsets for interest on certain government and semi-government securities
- tax offsets to approved resident lenders for infrastructure borrowings  

Do not include:
- amounts of the intercorporate dividend rebate as this is no longer available
- any foreign tax credit 
- any FDT offset
- any R&amp;D tax offset

The rebates/tax offsets shown here will not be refunded nor can they be carried forward - they are only offset against gross tax. If the total of rebates/tax offsets is more than the amount at Gross tax, reduce the amount of this label so that it equals the amount at Gross Tax. The aggregate amount this label cannot exceed Gross tax.

The following tax offsets are subject to refundable tax offset rules:
- R&amp;D tax offset
- film tax offsets under Division 376 of the ITAA 1997
- franking tax offsets claimed by life insurance companies to the extent that they relate to distributions paid on shares and other membership interests held on behalf of policy holders
- franking credits claimed by endorsed income tax exempt charities and deductible gift recipients that are entitled to a refund of excess franking credits. These entities may complete the Application for refund of franking credits - Endorsed income tax exempt charities and deductible gift recipients rather than the company tax return to obtain a refund.
The company may have a refundable amount to the extent that the total of these tax offsets exceeds the tax that would otherwise be payable by the company after all its other tax offsets are taken into account. Include the R&amp;D tax offset  at the element R&amp;D tax offset and the excess of other refundable tax offsets at  Other refundable credits and not at this label.</link:label>

- the company is an Australian resident company and either
- the company, or any of its associate entities, is an Australian controller of a foreign entity (explained below) or carries on business overseas at or through a PE, or
- the company is foreign controlled, either directly or indirectly (see below), or
- the company is a foreign resident company and carries on business in Australia at or through a PE or otherwise has assets that produce assessable income.

Exclusions
The thin capitalisation rules will not apply if:
- the company's debt deductions (combined with the debt deductions of its associate entities) do not exceed $250,000 in the income year, or
- in the case of an Australian company that is not foreign controlled, the combined value of the company's Australian assets and the Australian assets of its associates comprise at least 90% of the value of the total assets of the company and those associates.

Control
The rules measuring control take into account both direct and indirect interests that the company holds in the other entity (or vice versa), and the direct and indirect interests that associate entities of the company hold in the other entity. This means that an Australian company can be an Australian controller of a foreign entity even if it holds a direct interest of less than 50% in the foreign entity. Similarly, an Australian company can be foreign controlled even if its direct holding company is an Australian resident company."</link:label>
