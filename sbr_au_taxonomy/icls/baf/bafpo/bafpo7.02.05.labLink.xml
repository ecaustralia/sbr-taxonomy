For the purposes of this item, only report those amounts acquired, or intially recognised, during the relevant period.

Equity securities are to be determined in accordance with relevant accounting standards. They are generally defined as contracts that evidence a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all its liabilities. This includes equity securities lent or sold by the entity under repurchase agreements, where the transaction does not result in the transfer of the rights of ownership of the securities away from the entity to another party. Also included in the meaning of equity securities are unit trusts and interests in joint ventures.

The acquisition cost, or historical cost, of an asset is the original cost paid to acquire the asset, at the date the asset was initially acquired. Where the asset was acquired in stages, sum the initial acquisition cost of each stage, but only to the extent the acquisitions occurred during the relevant period.</link:label>

Equity investments or securities are, as defined by the Australian Accounting Standards, contracts that evidence a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all its liabilities. This includes equity securities lent or sold by the entity under repurchase agreements, where the transaction does not result in the transfer of the rights of ownership of the securities away from the entity to another party. Also included are interests in joint ventures.

If the reporting entity holds notes/hybrid securities which have characteristics of a debt security &amp; an equity security, these securities should be classified in the same manner as they appear in the entity's audited financial statements.

The disposal of an asset takes place if a change of ownership occurs, whether because of some act or event (such as damage) or by operation of law, e.g. when an asset is transferred from one person to another by way of sale or gift.

Proceeds are defined as the total consideration recieved or receivable following the disposal of an asset.</link:label>

The disposal of an asset takes place if a change of ownership occurs, whether because of some act or event (such as damage) or by operation of law, e.g. when an asset is transferred from one person to another by way of sale or gift.

Proceeds are defined as the total consideration recieved or receivable following the disposal of an asset.</link:label>

Report the net market value, or fair value, of debt securities other than those classified as any of the following:
     - Bills of Exchange;
     - Certificates of Deposit issued by banks; or
     - Bonds, notes, commercial paper or promissory notes.

A debt security is a transferable instrument evidencing a relationship of indebtedness. It is characterised by having a definable income stream that is not based on the economic performance of the issuing entity.

Bills of Exchange are unconditional orders drawn (issued) by one party, sent to another party for acceptance and made out to, or to the order of, a third party, or to bearer. It is a negotiable instrument that binds each endorser of the bill to pay on redemption should the acceptor fail to do so. These securities are issued at a discount to face value.     

Certificates of Deposit are certificates issued by a bank or other financial institution that indicate a specified sum of money has been deposited at the issuing depository institution.     

Notes are unconditional promises in writing made by one party to another, signed by the maker, engaging to pay on demand or at a fixed or determinable future time a sum certain in money for or to the order of a specified person or to bearer. It does not bind any other party to payment on redemption. These securities are issued at a discount to face value.

Net market value, or fair value, is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.</link:label>
