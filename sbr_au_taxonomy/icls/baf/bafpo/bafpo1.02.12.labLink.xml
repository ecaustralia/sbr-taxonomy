Derivatives are generally defined as those instruments/contracts, where the value is based on other products, and/or on prices associated with financial products. 

Derivative contracts involve: 

- Future delivery, receipt, or exchange of financial items such as cash or another derivative instrument; or

- Future exchange of real assets for financial items where the contract may be tradeable and has a market value. 

The contracts can either be binding on both parties (e.g. as with a currency swap) or subject to the exercise by one party of a right contained within the contract (as with options).</link:label>
