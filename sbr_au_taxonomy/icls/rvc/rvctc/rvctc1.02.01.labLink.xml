Under the existing law, balancing adjustment amounts are not to be included in the calculation of PAYG instalment income. This amount will be one of a variety of things included in taxpayer?s TOFA gains/losses reported at Item 7. As such it is necessary to separately identify this amount so as to ensure this amount is not included in the calculation of a taxpayer?s PAYG instalment income. It will be possible to remove this label in Taxtime 2016 as the balancing adjustment provisions only apply to the first 4 years the Division 230 applies to a taxpayer. (A loss box is required next to this label, for taxpayers to advise if this is an overall loss amount.)</link:label>
