This includes equity securities lent or sold by the entity under repurchase agreements, where the transaction does not result in the transfer of the rights of ownership of the securities away from the entity to another party. Also included are interests in joint ventures.

If the reporting entity holds listed notes/hybrid securities which have characteristics of a debt security &amp; an equity security, these securities should be classified in the same manner as they appear in the entity's audited financial statements.

The acquisition cost, or historical cost, of an asset is the original cost paid to acquire the asset, at the date the asset was initially acquired. Where the asset was acquired in stages, sum the initial acquisition cost of each stage, but only to the extent the acquisitions occurred during the relevant period.

The disposal of an asset takes place if a change of ownership occurs, whether because of some act or event (such as damage) or by operation of law, e.g. when an asset is transferred from one person to another by way of sale or gift.

Off-balance sheet asset exposures relate to those assets or rights that do not satisfy the recognition requirements of the relevant accounting standards and are therefore not recognised on the face of the balance sheet, or statement of financial position, such as contingent assets, performance-related rights and guarantees.</link:label>

Include: 
- Property investments acquired as part of the internal investment management of the reporting party; and 
- Underlying property investments held in the form of an external individually managed mandate/portfolio or discretely managed portfolio. 
Exclude: 
- Direct investments in property trusts (both listed and unlisted).

The acquisition cost, or historical cost, of an asset is the original cost paid to acquire the asset, at the date the asset was initially acquired. Where the asset was acquired in stages, sum the initial acquisition cost of each stage, but only to the extent the acquisitions occurred during the relevant period.

The disposal of an asset takes place if a change of ownership occurs, whether because of some act or event (such as damage) or by operation of law, e.g. when an asset is transferred from one person to another by way of sale or gift.

Off-balance sheet asset exposures relate to those assets or rights that do not satisfy the recognition requirements of the relevant accounting standards and are therefore not recognised on the face of the balance sheet, or statement of financial position, such as contingent assets, performance-related rights and guarantees.</link:label>

Report the value of all exposures, other than those exposures classified as any of the following:
- Securities under agreement to resell, being the receivable due from counterparties from whom the stock has been borrowed and with whom cash has been lodged;
- Investments represent assets or liabiltiies acquired or incurred principally for profit-taking purposes, and which have not been classified as trading.
- Receivables, being claims against customers and others for money, goods or services, arising during the ordinary course of business;
- Derivative financial instruments, being a financial instrument that is derived from some other asset, index, value or other variable (known as the underlying). Derivatives allow risk about the price of the underlying asset to be transferred from one party to another;
- Borrowings, being amounts received through an arrangement in which a lender gives money to a borrower, and the borrower agrees to repay the money, usually along with interest, at some future point in time. Usually, there is a predetermined time for repaying a loan, and generally the lender has to bear the risk that the borrower may not repay a loan;
- Payables and Creditors, being claims on the entity by it's suppliers and others for money, arising from the provision of goods or services by the supplier during the ordinary course of business; or
- Member benefits payable, including Defined Member Benefits &amp; accumulation/defined contribution benefits. 

This balancing item is to be reported as per the requirements on APRA forms SRF_120_0, SRF_220_0 and SRF_320_0.

Member Benefits represent those benefits arising from both accumulated/defined contributions plans and defined benefits plans. 

Under an accumulation/defined contributions plan, the entity's present obligation to pay benefits to members and beneficiaries in the future. It is calculated as the difference between the carrying amounts of the assets and the carrying amounts of the liabilities as at the relevant date. 

Under a defined benefits plan, accrued benefits of a defined benefit plan shall be measured, using actuarial assumptions and valuations where appropriate, as the present value of expected future payments to members arising from membership of the entity up to the measurement date. In absence of formal actuarial review, the amount is calculated as the difference between the carrying amounts of the assets and the carrying amounts of the liabilities as at the relevant date.</link:label>

Receivables represent claims against customers and others for money, goods or services, arising during the ordinary course of business.

An exposure represents a claim or commitment of an entity, recorded both on and off the balance sheet and which can be of the following in nature:
(a) Credit exposures (i.e. such as a money market placement with a Bank or holding of a corporation's debt securities);
(b) Asset exposures that are not in the nature of a credit exposure (e.g. a direct property investment); and
(c) Exposures in the nature of a liability or obligation to a single party or group of related parties.
An off-balance sheet exposure refers to an item that is not recognised in the statement of financial position, such as contingent assets and liabilities.

Net market value, or fair value, is the amount which could be expected to be received from the disposal of an asset in an orderly market; or in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties; after deducting costs expected to be incurred in realising the proceeds of such a disposal.</link:label>

Decreases due to maturities refer to the cessation of contractual regular contributions due to the maturity of a policy, i.e. following the completion of a policy's term. This would occur when a member retires and is paid his/her superannuation benefit, a policy owner reaches a defined age on an Endowment policy or the termination of a savings plan on or after the contractual period

Payables represent claims on the entity by it's suppliers and others for money, arising from the provision of goods or services by the supplier during the ordinary course of business.

Member benefits represent those benefits arising from both accumulated/defined contributions plans and defined benefits plans. 

Under an accumulation/defined contributions plan, the entity's present obligation to pay benefits to members and beneficiaries in the future. It is calculated as the difference between the carrying amounts of the assets and the carrying amounts of the liabilities as at the relevant date.

In absence of formal actuarial review, the amount is calculated as the difference between the carrying amounts of the assets and the carrying amounts of the liabilities as at the relevant date.

An exposure represents a claim or commitment of an entity, recorded both on and off the balance sheet and which can be the following in nature:
(a) Credit exposures (i.e. such as a money market placement with a Bank or holding of a corporation's debt securities);
(b) Asset exposures that are not in the nature of a credit exposure (e.g. a direct property investment); and
(c) Exposures in the nature of a liability or obligation to a single party or group of related parties.
An off-balance sheet exposure refers to an item that is not recognised in the statement of financial position, such as contingent assets and liabilities.
