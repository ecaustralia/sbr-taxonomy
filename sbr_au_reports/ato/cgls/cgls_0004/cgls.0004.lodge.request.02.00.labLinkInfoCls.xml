This will be done through the use of a refundable tax offset.  A number of conditions and integrity rules will apply:

â€¢ A quantitative cap of $1 million of losses in each income year will apply to the amount of losses that can be carried back;
â€¢ Up to the quantitative cap (and other limitations), companies may choose the amount of losses they wish to carry back;
â€¢ The amount of losses chosen to be carried-back is used by the entity to calculate its loss carry-back tax offset component; 
â€¢ The loss carry-back tax offset available to an entity is the least of the following three amounts: the entity's franking account balance; its loss carry-back tax offset component; and $1 million x current year corporate tax rate;
â€¢ The refundable tax offset is a debit to the companyâ€™s franking account balance;
â€¢ A one year carry-back period will be allowed for the 2012-13 income year, followed by a 2 year carry-back period from the 2013-14 income year onwards;
â€¢ Loss carry-back applies to revenue losses only;
â€¢ Where a loss is carried back it will no longer be available as a carried forward loss in future years;
â€¢ All of a companyâ€™s five immediately prior income years income tax returns must have been lodged;
â€¢ Loss integrity rules including continuity of ownership and same business tests will apply;
â€¢ Applies to companies including consolidated groups.</link:label>

company which did not satisfy the continuity of ownership and control tests but did satisfy the same business test.
For each joining company that transferred a same business test tax loss or same business test net capital loss to the head company, determine the year of income in which the joining company first failed the continuity of ownership or control tests.
â€˜Sameâ€™ means â€˜identicalâ€™ and not merely â€˜similarâ€™. The term â€˜same businessâ€™ is to be read as referring to the same business, in the sense of the identical business. However, the term does not mean identical in all respects. A company may expand or contract its activities without necessarily ceasing to carry on the same business. The organic growth of a business does not necessarily cause the business to fail the same business test provided the business retains its identity. However, if through a process of evolution a business changes its essential character, the entity may fail the test. Application of the same business test is a question of fact and is usually determined by a process of weighing up various relevant factors.
For more information, see sections 165-13 and 165-210 of the ITAA 1997, Taxation Ruling TR  999/9 and Taxation Ruling TR 2007/2.
The aim of it is to find out (in respect of companies that transferred losses to a head company of a consolidated group because a same business transfer test was satisfied):
â–  the period of time between the year of failure of the continuity of ownership or control transfer tests and the trial year, and
â–  the losses that failed the continuity of ownership or control tests at the joining time and in the trial year.

When a company joins a consolidated group any unused carry forward losses are transferred to the head company if the losses could have been utilised by the joining entity, assuming sufficient income or gains in the â€˜trial yearâ€™, which generally begins 12 months before joining the consolidated group and ends immediately after the joining time. In certain circumstances, the trial year may be a shorter period than 12 months. See subsection 707-120(2) of the ITAA 1997.</link:label>
