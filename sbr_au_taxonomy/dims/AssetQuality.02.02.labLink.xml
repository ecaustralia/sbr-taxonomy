Credit exposures have been past due for more than 90 days where the following criteria are met:

(1) the reporting party judges that the fair value of associated security, discounted to allow for reasonable realisation costs, is sufficient to cover the full outstanding value of the asset; and

(2) the facility is not subject to a regular repayment schedule and has remained continuously outside contractual or approved arrangements for a period of 90 days; or

(3) the facility is subject to a regular repayment schedule and:
    (3a) at least 90 calendar days have elapsed since the due date of a contractual payment that has not been met in full; and
    (3b) the total amount outside contractual arrangements is equivalent to at least 90 days' worth of contractual payments.</link:label>
