Note that where total dollar value of related-party dealings is to be calculated, these dealings should not be `netted off' (other than in the case of certain derivative instruments). That is, do not set off incomings and outgoings against each other to result in a lesser amount. Instead, add the amounts, both income derived and expenses incurred, to obtain the sum total of all such dealings.
Valid values are:
1: Comparable uncontrolled price (CUP) method
2: Resale price method
3: Cost-plus method
4: Profit split method
5: Transactional net margin method
6: Marginal costing
7: Cost-contribution arrangement
8: Apportionment of costs
9: Apportionment of income
10: Fixed mark-up applied to cost
11: Fixed percentage of resale price
12: Other arm's length methods</link:label>
