Investment securities are to be recorded in accordance with AASB 139.
Include all securities (stock) lent or sold under repurchase agreements. All securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements should be excluded.
Include holdings of debt securities issued by the parent entity, controlled entities, associated entities, joint venture entities and other branches under the same parent entity.</link:label>

Reporting Taxonomy Guidance
The amount of any provision for doubtful debts that relates to the investment income receivables.
Doubtful debt means it is no longer considered probable that amounts of accrued investment income (e.g. interest, dividends, distributions associated with the investment/asset) will be able to be collected by the entity.
