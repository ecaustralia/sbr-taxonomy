The definition of wages includes all employer-funded (before income tax) superannuation contributions in taxable wages. 
Superannuation subject to payroll tax includes employer contributions paid or payable:
â€¢ to superannuation funds within the meaning of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (Cth)
â€¢ as a superannuation guarantee charge within the meaning of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 (Cth)
â€¢ to the Superannuation Holding Accounts (SHA) special account (formerly known as Superannuation Holding Accounts Reserve) within the meaning of the Small Superannuation Accounts Act 1995 (Cth)
â€¢ to a retirement savings account within the meaning of the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997 (Cth), and
â€¢ as top-up payments to any other form of superannuation fund or scheme including payments to or in relation to unfunded or partly-funded superannuation schemes.
Note that taxable superannuation payments include payments paid in relation to both employees and deemed employees (e.g. certain contractors).
It should also be noted that from 1 July 2007 the value of any non-monetary employer-funded superannuation contribution is taxable for payroll tax purposes.

Specifically, the following termination payments are taxable: 

1. payments for actual services rendered up to the date of termination, 
2. accrued annual and long service leave,
3. employment termination payments.

Accrued leave 
Both accrued annual leave and long service leave payments are taxable when paid to an employee on termination of the employee's services. It should be noted that leave payments paid to a continuing employee are also subject to payroll tax. 

Employment Termination Payments
Payroll Tax applies to an employment termination payment (ETP), as defined in section 82-130 of the ITAA, when paid by an employer as a result of an employee's termination. The amount subject to payroll tax is the whole of the ETP paid by the employer (whether paid to the employee or to a roll-over fund), less any component which is exempt income when received by the employee.  ETPs paid by employers may include payments for: 
 â€¢ unused sick leave or rostered days off,
â€¢  ex-gratia payments or 'golden handshakes',
â€¢ payment in lieu of notice or service contract payouts,
â€¢ compensation for loss of job or wrongful dismissal,
â€¢ genuine redundancy payment or early retirement payments in excess of the income tax free limit.

Under certain circumstances, payments to contractors are taxable. The payments are usually taxable where the contractor:
â€¢ provides essentially labour services, and
â€¢ works exclusively or primarily for one principal.
The provisions relating to contractors deem such contractors to be 'employees' and the payments made to them, excluding goods and services tax (GST), are deemed to be wages. 
The term 'contractors' is a generic one, which includes sub-contractors, consultants and outworkers. The provisions apply regardless of whether the contractor provides services via a company, trust, partnership or as a sole trader.

In practical terms, the contractor provisions initially capture all contracts for the performance of work. However, the provisions contain several exemptions and if any one applies to a particular contract, the payments under that contract are not taxable.  These provisions allow the Commissioner to disregard, and treat as taxable, an arrangement that exists only to reduce or avoid payroll tax.

As a general rule, allowances are taxable in full even if they are paid to compensate an employee for an expense which may be (or has been) incurred in relation to work (e.g. uniform allowances). This is the case even if an allowance is paid under an award or employment agreement (e.g. overtime meal allowances). The only exceptions to the general rule that allowances are taxable in full relate to motor vehicle, accommodation and living away from home allowances. Under the Act, from 1 July 2007, new conditions apply for motor vehicle and accommodation allowances.    

Motor Vehicle Allowances - are paid to compensate employees for any business use of their own private vehicle. 

Accommodation allowances - are paid to cover temporary accommodation costs necessarily incurred as a consequence of employment. 

Living away from Home Allowances - is paid to compensate an employee for additional expenses he or she may incur as a result of being required to temporarily live away from home in order to perform his or her duties of employment.
 
Reimbursements - of expenses incurred by employees on behalf of their employers are not taxable unless they have a taxable value under the FBTAA.

Bonuses - payment additional to an employeeâ€™s normal wage or salary. It is usually paid as an incentive or reward for some additional or outstanding service. Often it is paid out of profit realised, in reward to those whose services have contributed to the making of the profit. In the case of an employee, the payment of a bonus is ordinarily made as a voluntary gift, ex gratia, in recognition of the extent to which the services of that employee have contributed to the making of the profit. Such payments are always taxable. 
 
Often expatriates, who have worked in Victoria, will receive bonuses overseas paid by the overseas parent company as a result of the employers performance or the group performance. From 1 July 2009 the new nexus provisions were introduced. Bonuses received will be subject to payroll tax in the jurisdiction where the services were performed in the month the bonuses are paid or payable. 

Commissions - payments based on achievement or sales and are usually calculated on a percentage basis. These are always taxable when paid to employees, whether they are the sole method of remuneration or paid in addition to a basic wage or retainer.

As a general rule, benefits that are taxable under the FBTAA are also taxable under the Act and must be declared as wages for payroll tax purposes. The only exception to this general rule is a tax-exempt body entertainment fringe benefit as defined in the FBTAA. Although tax-exempt fringe benefits are subject to FBT, they are specifically exempt for payroll tax purposes. If a benefit is exempt under the FBTAA (e.g. a portable electronic device such as a laptop) it is also exempt from payroll tax. In addition, if a fringe benefit has a 'nil' taxable value for FBT purposes (e.g. taxable value is reduced to 'nil' under the 'otherwise deductible' rule), it also has a 'nil' taxable value for payroll tax purposes. Records used to substantiate FBT claims made to the ATO are also acceptable for payroll tax. From 1 July 2007, the fringe benefit taxable value for payroll tax purposes is determined by grossing up all fringe benefits by using only the Type 2 factor. Please note that the ATO requires that certain fringe benefits, referred to as the 'reportable fringe benefits amount', must be shown on the employee's payment summary if the benefits amount exceeds $1000. These reportable fringe benefits may not include the value of all fringe benefits provided to employees and is not necessarily the amount to be used for payroll tax purposes.                         

Period Definition - Even though the FBT year runs from 1 April to 31 March and the payroll tax Annual Reconciliation year runs from 1 July to 30 June, the Payroll Tax Act 2007 deems the amount of fringe benefits declared in the FBT return as if it was for the payroll tax financial year. This is on the basis that both periods are twelve months. Victorian Component Determination - If you are unable to accurately determine the Victorian component of your fringe benefits, you can declare the amount based on the proportion of your total Victorian wages (excluding fringe benefits) to your total Australian wages (excluding fringe benefits).

Before 1 July 2007, the value of shares and options granted to employees was not subject to payroll tax.   

However, from 1 July 2007, the value of an employerâ€™s contribution to any grant of a share or option to an employee or deemed employee, a director or former director, or member (or former member) of the governing body of the company is subject to payroll tax.  

The 'granting' of a share or an option occurs if a person acquires a share or, in the case of an option, a right to the share. A value of the share or option becomes liable on the 'relevant day'. The employer can elect to treat the relevant day as either the date that the share or option is granted to the employee or the 'vesting date'.  

The vesting date for a share is the date when any conditions applying to granting the share have been met and the employeeâ€™s legal or beneficial interest in the share cannot be rescinded. The vesting date for an option is the earlier of either one of two dates:  

â€¢ when the share to which the option relates is granted to the employee, or 
â€¢ when the right under the option to have the relevant share transferred, allotted or vested is exercised by the employee.  

If the granting of a share or option constitutes wages, the amount of the wages is the market value of the share or option on the relevant day, less any consideration paid or given by the employee for the grant (excluding consideration in the form of services rendered), as determined in accordance with the Income tax provisions contained in Subdivision F of Division 13A of Part 111 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth). If an employer does not include the value of a grant of a share or option in its taxable wages for the financial year in which the grant occurred, the wages constituted by the grant are take to have been paid or payable on the vesting date of the share or option.  

The employer may reduce the taxable wages declared by the value of any previously declared share or option value, if the grant of a share or option was rescinded because the vesting conditions have not been met. This reduction in the taxable wages would not apply in circumstances where the employee decided not to exercise the option.  

If the grant of a share or option is withdrawn, cancelled or exchanged before the vesting date for some valuable consideration other than a share or option, the date on which that occurs is deemed to be the vesting date and the taxable amount is taken to be the value of the consideration.  

The granting of a share or option, which is classified as a fringe benefit under the FBTAA is not treated as a fringe benefit, but rather as wages for payroll tax purposes.  

Nexus Rules 
Certain circumstances relating to shares and options attract different nexus rules. These are outlined as follows: 
a) The employee performs services in more than one Australian jurisdiction and / or partly overseas, and the employee does not have a principal place of residence in an Australian jurisdiction, and the employer does not have a registered business address or a principle place of business in an Australian jurisdiction. 
b) The employee performs services wholly outside all Australian jurisdictions for less than six months but is paid in an Australian jurisdiction. In these situations, where the grant of a share or option constitutes wages, the shares or options are taken to be paid or payable in the jurisdiction where the share is a share in a local company.

Shares or options are granted to an employee that may have certain conditions attached to them that the employee needs to meet in order to have the shares or options allocated to them, such as performance targets. If the employee does not meet the criteria and the employer has declared the taxable value at the granting date, the employer will need to offset the over-declared amount, rather than seeking a refund.
