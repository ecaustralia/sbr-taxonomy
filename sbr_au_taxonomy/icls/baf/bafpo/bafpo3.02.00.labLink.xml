Reinsurance recoverables on outstanding claims is the reinsured portion of the outstanding claims provision to be recovered from reinsurers on settling the outstanding claims provision.  Accordingly estimation of reinsurance recoveries relating to the outstanding claims provision is to be estimated on a basis similar with the measurement of the claims liabilities to which it relates.
The amount reported should also include the amounts due from reinsurers under reinsurance contracts that do not meet the reinsurance documentation test, specified in GPS 112.</link:label>

It is likely that the recognition of the Premiums Liabilities and Outstanding Claims Provisions in accordance with GPS 310 will give rise to tax effect accounting considerations. The measurement and recognition of tax effect accounting items (e.g. deferred tax assets) is to be determined in accordance with the requirements of AASB 112 &apos;Income Taxes&apos;.
If the technical insurance provisions represent timing differences between the recognition as an expense for accounting purposes and as a deductible expense for taxation purposes, then the associated measurement and recognition of taxation expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities is to be determined in accordance with AASB 112 &apos;Income Taxes&apos;.
The calculation of the amounts is to be determined in accordance with prospective accounting principles.
Amounts reported here are those due within the next 12 months.</link:label>

It is likely that the recognition of the Premiums Liabilities and Outstanding Claims Provisions in accordance with GPS 310 will give rise to tax effect accounting considerations. The measurement and recognition of tax effect accounting items (e.g. deferred tax assets) is to be determined in accordance with the requirements of AASB 112 &apos;Income Taxes&apos;. If the technical insurance provisions represent timing differences between the recognition as an expense for accounting purposes and as a deductible expense for taxation purposes, then the associated measurement and recognition of taxation expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities is to be determined in accordance with AASB 112 &apos;Income Taxes&apos;. The calculation of the amounts is to be determined in accordance with prospective accounting principles. Amounts reported here are those not due within the next 12 months.</link:label>
