Derivatives are generally defined as those instruments/contracts, where the value is based on other products, and/or on prices associated with financial products. Derivative contracts involve:
- Future delivery, receipt or exchange of financial items such as cash or another derivative instrument; or
- Future exchange of real assets for financial items where the contract may be tradeable and has a market value.
The contracts can either be binding on both parties (e.g. as with a currency swap) or subject to the exercise by one party of a right contained within the contract (as with options).

Delta-weighted position is calculated by multiplying the market value of the underlying position by the absolute value of the delta on that position. Delta represents the rate of change of an options price for a unit change in the price of the underlying asset.</link:label>

Capital base represents the sum of total tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital, net of deductions from capital, and is calculated for capital adequacy purposes in accordance with relevant prudential standards.

Total on and off-balance sheet exposures is determined in accordance with Prudential Standard APS 221, calculated as the sum of the following amounts:
     - On-balance sheet exposures, including all loans and advances, holding of debt and equity securities, and all other counterparty claims. Any accrued income associated with the exposure should also be included (e.g. interest, dividends);
     - Non-market-related off-balance sheet exposures, including all contingencies and commitments, whether revocable or not, which have been advised to the counterparty. Any potential chargeback exposures to the counterparty arising from credit card acquiring activities should also be included. Exclude internal limits that have not been formally advised to the counterparty or group of related counterparties and may be cancelled at the reporting party's discretion; and
     - Market-related off-balance sheet exposures, including foreign exchange and interest rate derivative contracts etc.

Exclude internal limits that have not been formally advised to the counterparty or group of related counterparties and may be cancelled at the reporting party's discretion.

The value of all unused commitments to the counterparty (do not apply credit conversion factors or risk weightings to the value) is to be reported on a net basis, i.e. net of exposures excluded under APS 221, specifically:
      - exposures deducted from the ADI's capital (refer APS 111);
     - exposures to the extent that they are secured by cash deposits (subject to satisfying the criteria in APS 112);
     - exposures to the extent that they are guaranteed by, or secured against securities issued by, governments or central banks (subject to satisfying the conditions in APS 112); 
     - exposures arising in the course of settlement of market-related contracts;
     - exposures to an ADI required as part of a liquidity support arrangement that has been certified by APRA under section 11CB of the Banking Act 1959; and 
     - exposures to the extent that they have been written off or specifically provided for.

Exposures arising from repos (i.e. sale and repurchase agreements) and reverse repos (i.e. purchase and resale agreements) of securities should be reported as exposures to the issuer of the securities and collateralised loans to the counterparty respectively.

Off-balance sheet refers to assets or liabilities that are not recognised or recorded on the statement of financial position of the reporting party because they do not satisfy the asset or liability accounting recognition requirements.</link:label>

This is the value, as at the relevant date, of capitalised expenses other than those already listed on ARF_110_0_1 and ARF_110_0_2 (where applicable). This includes capitalised expenses of a general nature, such as strategic business development initiatives, and other forms of transaction costs and like costs that are required to be deferred/capitalised and amortised in accordance with accounting standards.

This item is reported as a deduction from Tier 1 capital for capital adequacy purposes and is to be determined in accordance with the Banking Act 1959, relevant Prudential Standards and associated Guidance Notes.

The balance of any transaction costs and like items that are capitalised and deferred as an asset must be netted off against the balance of any income deferred as a liability relating to the products giving rise to the capitalised transaction costs (i.e. only deferred costs and income in particular product portfolios may be netted). 

Any positive net balance of capitalised transaction costs must be deducted from Tier 1 capital in accordance with the relevant Prudential Standard. Any surplus of up-front fee income received over deferred costs may be added to Tier 1 capital provided the up-front fee income received satisfies the criteria set under Prudential Standard APS 111. Otherwise, up-front fee income received must not be added to capital.</link:label>

General reserves are created from the appropriation of profits by an entity (or the group of entities) after the payment of all dividends and tax. These may include:

     (a) reserves representing the offset to a charge to profit and loss of the entity arising from equity-settled share-based payments (i.e. shares and/or share options) granted to employees as part of their remuneration package (including any shares or share options granted to employees by way of bonus arrangements associated with their employment, and shares or share options granted to employees of an acquired institution in return for continued services). This is provided that:
          (i) the shares or share options granted relate only to the ordinary shares of the entity itself; and
          (ii) there are no circumstances in which such remuneration (including bonuses) can be realised, in part or full, other than by way of the issue of ordinary shares of the entity i.e. there is no right for remuneration to be converted to a payment in another form (e.g. cash).

All other reserves associated with share-based payments (refer to Australian accounting standard AASB 2 Share-based Payment) must be excluded from this item; and

     (b) cumulative unrealised gains or losses on hedges that offset gains or losses on reserves included in Tier 1 capital (e.g. movements in the currency value of foreign-currency-denominated hedging instruments which offset movements in foreign-currency-denominated items recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve). This includes fair value gains or losses on derivatives representing effective economic hedges of assets.

Equivalents to retained first loss positions arise:

This is calculated as the Total Liabilities plus Shareholders Equity as determined in accordance with accounting standards; less the Eligible Capital Base; plus Off Balance Sheet Irrevocable Commitments.
     
The Eligible Capital Base is comprised of the Total Capital Base as determined in accordance with prudential standards; less the value of Adjusted HQLA Placements.
     
Adjusted HQLA Placements are calculated as follows:     
If the total deposits placed with the reporting party by other Approved Deposit-taking Institutions (ADIs) exceed the amount of total deposits the reporting party has placed with ADIs, then this amount is the total deposits the reporting party has placed with other ADIs (i.e. deposit assets), otherwise it is the total deposits placed with the reporting party (i.e. deposit liabilities) by other ADIs.
     
Off Balance Sheet Irrevocable Commitments comprise the following:

     -  the value, as at the relevant date, of any potential credit exposures arising from trade-related contingencies, which are contingent liabilities arising from a trade-related obligation that is secured against an underlying shipment of goods for both issuing and confirming parties;
     - the value, as at the relevant date, of any potential credit exposures arising from performance-related contingencies, which represent contingent liabilities involving an irrevocable obligation to pay a third party in the event that a counterparty fails to fulfil or perform a contractual non-monetary obligation, such as delivery of goods by a specified date, (i.e. the risk of loss depends on a future event that is not directly related to the creditworthiness of the counterparty involved);
     - the value, as at the relevant date, of any potential credit exposures arising from sale and repurchase agreements ('Repos'), which represent arrangements whereby an entity sells a loan, security or other asset to another party with a commitment to repurchase the asset at an agreed price on an agreed future date;
     - the value, as at the relevant date, of any potential credit exposures arising from assets sold with recourse, being asset sales (to the extent that such assets are not included on-balance sheet) by an entity where the holder of the asset is entitled to 'put' the asset back to the entity within an agreed period or under certain prescribed circumstances (e.g. deterioration in the value or credit quality of the asset concerned);
     - the value, as at the relevant date, of any potential credit exposures arising from forward asset purchases deemed non-market-related off-balance sheet transactions. These are commitments to purchase at a specified future date, and on pre-arranged terms, a loan, security or other asset from another entity, including written put options on specified assets with the character of a credit enhancement;
     - the value, as at the relevant date, of undrawn irrevocable commitments in the form of formal standby facilities and credit lines to the reporting party's customers and APRA industry support arrangements only. This represents the maximum unused portion of the commitment that could be drawn during the remaining period to maturity. This does not include standby facilities in place to support the reporting party's operations;
     - the value, as at the relevant date, of overdraft facilities available to the reporting party; and
     - the value, as at the relevant date, of undrawn irrevocable non-market-related commitments available for redraw under redraw facilities, but which are not certain of drawdown. This represents the maximum unused portion of the commitment that could be drawn during the remaining period to maturity but not does include amounts related to revolving credit facilities.</link:label>

This item is reported for capital adequacy purposes and is to be determined in accordance with the relevant prudential standards. The reporting party may net claims and obligations with a counterparty that are covered by a legally binding eligible bilateral netting agreement. 

This balancing item represents the value of total market-related off-balance sheet contracts (including credit derivatives) less those contracts which are classed as any of the following:
- Interest rate contracts;
- Foreign exchange contracts;
- Equity contracts; or
- Precious metal, Gold and other commodity contracts.

Derivatives are generally defined as those instruments/contracts, where the value is based on other products, and/or on prices associated with financial products. Derivative contracts involve:
- Future delivery, receipt or exchange of financial items such as cash or another derivative instrument; or
- Future exchange of real assets for financial items where the contract may be tradeable and has a market value.
The contracts can either be binding on both parties (e.g. as with a currency swap) or subject to the exercise by one party of a right contained within the contract (as with options).

Report this item regardless of whether favourable or unfavourable to the reporting entity.</link:label>

IRRBB capital requirement represents the regulatory capital that an entity is required to hold against its exposure to IRRBB in accordance with Prudential Standards.

Repricing risk represents the risk of loss in earnings or economic value caused by a change in the overall level of interest rates (that is, a 'parallel shift' in the yield curve). This risk arises from mismatches in the repricing dates of an entity's banking book items.

Yield curve risk represents the risk of loss in earnings or economic value caused by a change in the relative levels of interest rates for different tenors (that is, a change in the slope or shape of the yield curve). This risk arises from mismatches in the repricing dates of an entity's banking book items.

Basis risk represents the risk of loss in earnings or economic value arising from differences between the actual and expected interest margins on banking book items, where 'margin' means the difference between the interest rate on the items and the implied cost of funds for those items.

Optionality risk represents the risk of loss in earnings or economic value due to the existence of stand-alone or embedded options, to the extent that the potential for those losses is not included in the measurement of repricing, yield curve or basis risks.</link:label>

Equity positions include on and off-balance sheet exposures which are affected by changes in Equity prices. This includes holdings of, or positions in:
     - ordinary shares, whether voting or non-voting;
     - convertible securities that behave like equities;
     - commitments to buy or sell equity securities; and
     - any other instruments that exhibit market behaviour similar to equities.

VaR, or Value at Risk, is a technique used to estimate the likelihood of losses in a portfolio, based on the analysis of historical price movements and volatilities, over a specified observation period.

For the purposes of this item the amount reported is the average of the 99% ten-day VaR number calculated daily over the relevant period. A 99% ten-day VaR represents a simulated mark-to-market loss for which there is a 1% probability of occurrence over the next ten days, assuming there is no trading of the portfolio.

The scaling factor consists of a multiplication factor and a plus factor, as determined in accordance with relevant prudential standards. The multiplication factor is set for each reporting party by APRA, and is subject to a minimum of three. A plus factor may also be required by APRA. This factor relates directly to back-testing results from the most recent 250 trading days prior to and including the relevant date.</link:label>

Delta, in this context, represents the impact of underlying interest rate movements on the overall portfolio value.

VaR, or Value at Risk, is a technique used to estimate the likelihood of losses in a portfolio based on analysis of historical price movements and volatilities over a specified observation period.

For the purposes of this item the amount reported is the 99% ten-day VaR number calculated as at the relevant date. Therefore, the number reported will represent a simulated mark-to-market loss for which there is a 1% probability of occurrence over the next ten days, assuming there is no trading of the portfolio.</link:label>
