In the case of an intangible asset, the term 'amortisation' is generally used instead of 'depreciation'.

Amortisation of Intangible Assets

Finite life
An intangible asset with a finite useful life is systematically amortised over its useful life from the time that it is available for use until it is either derecognised or classified as held for sale in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations.  The amortisation period and method must be reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period and changes are accounted for  as changes in accounting estimates (see International Accounting Standards [IAS] 8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors). The residual value is assumed to be zero unless there is:
- a commitment by a third party to purchase the asset at the end of its useful life, or
- an active market for the asset in which its residual value can be determined and it is probable that such a market will exist at the end of the asset's useful life.

Indefinite life
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life shall not be amortised. Instead, such intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of assets. An asset is regarded as having an indefinite useful life when, based on an analysis of all the relevant factors, there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate net cash inflows for the entity. The useful life shall be reviewed annually to determine whether circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life assessment. If a change is required to a finite useful life, the change in estimate shall be accounted for in accordance with IAS 8.

A finance lease may have depreciation/amortisation expenses associated with it. A Financial Lease is a contract between lessor and lessee whereby the lessor purchases a good that is put at the disposal of the lessee and the lessee pays rentals that enable the lessor, over the period of the contract, to cover all, or virtually all, costs, including interest; all the risks and rewards of ownership are, de facto, transferred from the legal owner of the good (the lessor) to the user of the good (the lessee).

Includes: (for lessees only)
- Depreciation/amortisation expenses in respect of finance leases.

Excludes: (for lessors only)
- Depreciation/amortisation expenses in respect of finance leases.</link:label>

Land tax is imposed by all States (including the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), but not Northern Territory (NT)) and is normally based on ownership or use of the land, except in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) where the tax is also payable on leases of land. The imposition of land tax is controlled by seven separate legislatures and is broadly based on the unimproved value of the land.

Land rates are annual charges levied by local Government for the provision of local Government services. Examples of local Government services include road maintenance, park maintenance, libraries, street lighting and acting as a planning authority.</link:label>

Remaining capital gains are reduced, in any order, by any unapplied net capital losses from previous reporting periods. Any remaining discount capital gains, if applicable, are reduced by the discount percentage. (For further information on discount capital gains and the discount percentage see Division 115 of ITAA 1997) If the entity is carrying on a small business, apply the small business concessions to further reduce the capital gains (whether or not the gains are discount capital gains). (For the small business concessions see Division 152 of ITAA 1997). Add up any remaining capital gains that are not discount capital gains and any remaining discount capital gains.

Rent and hiring income is obtained from payment made for the use of land or property usually, but not necessarily, based on a lease.

A lease is an agreement whereby the owner of an asset, the lessor, conveys to another party, the lessee, the right to use the asset for an agreed period of time in return for a payment or series of payments.

This includes income from operating leases but excludes income from finance leases.</link:label>
