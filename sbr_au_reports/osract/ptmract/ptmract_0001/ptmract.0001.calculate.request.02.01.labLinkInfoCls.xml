Primarily, the types of benefits are those which are presently subject to Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) under the Commonwealth's Fringe Benefits Assessment Act 1986 (the FBT Act).

Where a benefit is provided by an employer, the value of the benefit for the purpose of assessing payroll tax liability is the amount that would be defined as the 'fringe benefits taxable amount' for the purposes of the FBT Act.  The 'fringe benefits taxable amount' is the actual value of the fringe benefit to the employee and is known as the grossed up, or tax inclusive amount.

Benefits that attract a fringe benefits tax liability, a single gross-up factor (Type 2) is used for calculating the value of such benefits as wages for payroll tax purposes (section 3A of the Payroll Tax Act).

Questions specifically about the FBT Act should be directed to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), Telephone: 13 28 61.</link:label>

The provisions relating to contractors deem such contractors to be employees and deem payment made to them to be wages.  
The term `contractors` is a generic one, and includes sub-contractors, consultants, outworkers and so on. The provisions apply regardless of whether the contractor provides services through a company, trust, partnership or as a sole trader. Exemptions: In practical terms, the contractor provisions initially capture all contracts for the performance of work. However, the provisions contain exemptions, and if any one of the exemptions applies to a particular contract, the payments under that contract will not be taxable. The exemptions are: 1) the provision of labour is ancillary to the supply of or use of the goods and equipment under the contract; and 2) the services provided by the contractor are not ordinarily required by the principal and the contractor ordinarily renders such services to the public generally.</link:label>
