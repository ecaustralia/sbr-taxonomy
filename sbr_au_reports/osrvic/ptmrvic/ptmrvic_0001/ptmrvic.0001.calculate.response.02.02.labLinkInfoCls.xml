A deduction is pre-populated on the monthly return lodgement. With the exception of Ordinary group members and those employers with a 'deduction denied' indicator, the pre-populated deduction can be amended. The deduction an employer is entitled to claim may vary according to whether the employer is a member of a group or an interstate employer. 

Group employers
Employers who are members of a group are not all entitled to a deduction. Only one member who is designated by the group (the designated group employer) is entitled to claim a deduction on behalf of the group. The other members (the ordinary members) are not entitled to claim any deduction and must pay tax on their total Victorian wages. 

Interstate employers
Employers or groups of employers who also pay Interstate wages are only entitled to a partial deduction in Victoria. This partial deduction is the maximum deduction, adjusted by the ratio of the total Victorian taxable wages to total Australian wages.  The ratio can be calculated by using either actual wages for that month or the estimated wages which were provided by the employer in the prior yearâ€™s annual reconciliation or at the time of registration.</link:label>
