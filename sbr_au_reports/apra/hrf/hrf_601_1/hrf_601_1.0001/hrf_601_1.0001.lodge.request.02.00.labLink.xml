New policies/persons includes reinstated policies and persons, where those policies and person were counted as discontinued in a previous quarter due to their suspension. Where there are births or deaths within an existing policy this will constitute new persons or discontinued persons but not new or discontinued policies. When a policy is transferring to another state and at the same time transferring to another policy, it is to be entered: under the policy they are leaving, report under transferring to another state; under the policy they are entering report under transferring from another policy. Transfers to and from another policy refers to transfers between the treatment types of “Hospital Treatment Only”, “Hospital Treatment and General Treatment” and General Treatment Only .
