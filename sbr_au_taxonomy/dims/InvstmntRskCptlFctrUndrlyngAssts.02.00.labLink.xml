Items with a capital factor of 0% are amounts required to be deducted from the reporting party's capital base under the relevant Prudential Standards and amounts recorded on the balance sheet in relation to derivatives and direct credit substitutes.

A derivative is a financial instrument that is derived from some other asset, index, value or other variable (known as the underlying). Derivatives allow risk about the price of the underlying asset to be transferred from one party to another.

Derivative contracts involve:
- Future delivery, receipt or exchange of financial items such as cash or another derivative instrument; or
- Future exchange of real assets for financial items where the contract may be tradeable and has a market value.
The contracts can either be binding on both parties (e.g. as with a currency swap) or subject to the exercise by one party of a right contained within the contract (as with options).

A direct credit substitute is any irrevocable off-balance sheet obligation that carries the same credit risk as a direct extension of credit, such as an undertaking to make a payment to a third party in the event that a counterparty fails to meet a financial obligation, or an undertaking to a counterparty to acquire a potential claim on another party in the event of default by that party, constitutes a direct credit substitute (i.e. the risk of loss depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty or the party on that a potential claim is acquired).

Items with a capital factor of 100% are reinsurance recoverables from non-APRA-authorised reinsurers with an APRA counterparty rating grade of 4, 5 or unrated, which remain recoverable on and from the second annual balance date after the event giving rise to the recoverable.

APRA counterparty rating grades of 4 and  5 is as defined in the relevant prudential standard.

These items are reinsurance recoverables arising from contracts incepting on or after 31 December 2008 with non-APRA-authorised reinsurers that have an APRA counterparty rating grade of 4, 5 or unrated, which remain recoverable on and from the second annual balance date after the event giving rise to the recoverable. For a claims made policy this refers to reinsurance recoverables on and from the second annual balance date after a claim notification was made. This includes those where the counterparty rating grade is 1, 2 or 3; and the recoverable has become due and payable; and is overdue for more than six months since a request for payment has been made; and there is no formal dispute between the reporting party and the insurer in relation to that receivable.</link:label>

A direct credit substitute is any irrevocable off-balance sheet obligation that carries the same credit risk as a direct extension of credit, such as an undertaking to make a payment to a third party in the event that a counterparty fails to meet a financial obligation, or an undertaking to a counterparty to acquire a potential claim on another party in the event of default by that party, constitutes a direct credit substitute (i.e. the risk of loss depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty or the party on that a potential claim is acquired).</link:label>
