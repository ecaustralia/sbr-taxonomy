If the worker is a specific individual, is essentially only providing the labour (and in the case of a tradesperson the tools of trade), and is being paid an hourly or piecemeal rate, then it will generally be considered that they are engaged under a contract of service, even if the payment for the work performed is being made to the worker's company, partnership or family trust.</link:label>
