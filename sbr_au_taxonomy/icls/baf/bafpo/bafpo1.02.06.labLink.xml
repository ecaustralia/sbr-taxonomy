- the value of funded loans (net of specific prudential provisions for impairment), regardless of interest rate, that are classified by the reporting party as non-accrual or restructured (due to impairment) loans.
                                                                                                                                                          
A bill of exchange is an unconditional order drawn (issued) by one party, sent to another party (usually a bank) for acceptance and made out to, or to the order of, a third party, or to a bearer.
                                                                                                                                                      
Accepted bills of exchange have been signed by an entity as the drawee which 'accepts' liability to pay out the funds on the due date.
                                                                                                                                                      
Endorsement of a bill of exchange creates a contingent liability by the endorser to pay out the funds conditional on the bearer/holder demanding payment.
                                                                                                                                                      
Funded Loans are all loans and advances for which the interest rate is set by reference to money market rates, such as cash and bank bill rates. Loans and advances are those financial assets categorised as "Loans and Receivables" in the accounting standards, other than "Trade Receivables" and "Cash".
                                                                                                                                                   
The effective interest rate used should equate to the annual cost to the customer of a bill. It should comprise the bill discount rate expressed as annual rate, plus all fees - other than establishment fees - charged for providing the facility, also expressed as an annual percentage of the bills' face value. Where the discount rate on a bill is not known, an estimate based on prevailing market rates should be used. Bill fees include acceptance or endorsement fees, facility fees, line fees, activation fees, usage fees, rollover fees and handling fees.

Derivatives are generally defined as those instruments/contracts, where the value is based on other products, and/or on prices associated with financial products. Derivative contracts involve:
- Future delivery, receipt or exchange of financial items such as cash or another derivative instrument; or
- Future exchange of real assets for financial items where the contract may be tradeable and has a market value.
The contracts can either be binding on both parties (e.g. as with a currency swap) or subject to the exercise by one party of a right contained within the contract (as with options).</link:label>

      - they are a resident of the same country as the business unit that holds the claim but the claim is in a currency other than the official currency of that country.        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
A financial asset consists of money or a claim against another person or business (the counterparty) that can be converted into money.

Outwards risk transfers are calculated as the value of claims of the reporting party to a particular country as at the relevant date, where the immediate risk counterparty resides in the same country,  but the ultimate counterparty resides in another; plus the value of claims where the risk is transferred from one sector to another, but where the claim is still to the same country (for example, include a claim where the immediate risk lies with a bank in the UK, and the ultimate risk lies with the UK non-bank private sector).
                                                                                                                  
The immediate counterparty is the one from whom the reporting party directly derives its return on investment in the financial asset and on whom the reporting party has the primary claim when liquidating the asset.
                                                                                                                                                          
The ultimate risk counterparty is the one where the final risk in relation to the financial asset lies - the one on whom the reporting party will make the final claim should all other counterparties fail to honour the claim (e.g. guarantors, security providers).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
A claim is a financial asset and consists of money or a claim against another person or business (the counterparty) that can be converted into money.  It does not include intangible or operational assets of the reporting party nor does it include claims arising as a result of operational requirements of the business such as trade receivables or deferred tax assets.

Outward risk transfers do not include the reporting entity's claims where the immediate counterparties are residents of the reporting entity's home country.</link:label>

Endorsement of a bill of exchange creates a contingent liability by the endorser to pay out the funds conditional on the bearer/holder demanding payment</link:label>

This represents the maximum unused portion of the commitment that could be drawn during the remaining period to maturity. Any drawn portion of a commitment forms part of an entity's on-balance sheet exposure and is not to be reported at this item.
     
Commitments are generally considered to have arisen once the reporting party makes a firm offer to a client (i.e. customer acceptance is not required). Therefore, a commitment will arise once a letter of offer is provided to the client by the reporting party.

Reinsurance assets are any amounts due to the reporting party under a reinsurance arrangement, determined in accordance with prudential standards.

Deferred acquisition costs are to be determined in accordance with relevant accounting standards.

Deferred Reinsurance Expense (DRE) represents the deferral of reinsurance expense in accordance with the pattern of reinsurance service received.

Reinsurance expense is to be recognised in accordance with the pattern of reinsurance service received as required by relevant Accounting Standards. Reinsurance expense will be recognised from the attachment date over the period of indemnity of the reinsurance contract in accordance with the expected pattern of the incident of risk. This may vary according to the type of reinsurance contract as outlined below.

For reinsurance written on risks attaching or, equivalently, an underwriting period basis, current reinsurance contracts are fully matched to the underlying insurance portfolios. Reinsurance coverage for the underlying portfolio is recognised as the underlying policies are written.

For reinsurance written on a losses occurring basis, current reinsurance contracts provide coverage for any risks exposed during the reinsurance period irrespective of when the underlying business was written. Such reinsurance covers both the unexpired portion of policies in force at the contract commencement date and that portion of new business and renewals written during the year that is earned up to the contract expiry date. This latter portion relates to business which has not yet been written at the contract commencement date.

It is expected that initially the full minimum and deposit premium would be recognised as an expense, with any necessary adjustments due to experience at subsequent relevant dates.

Where payments under a reinsurance contract extend beyond the current year of cover, reinsurance expense is to be discounted using similar discount rates as required in measuring insurance liabilities in accordance with accounting standards.</link:label>

A floating charge is a form of security provided by a borrower to a lender where the creditor's charge or claim is not lodged over a particular asset, but is fixed on a specific asset, or group of assets, only if the default occurs. This process is called crystallisation of the charge. A floating charge leaves the debtor free to buy, sell and vary the assets until such time as the charge is crystallised.</link:label>
