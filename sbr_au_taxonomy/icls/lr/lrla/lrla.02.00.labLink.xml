Salary sacrificing is used by taxpayers who attract income tax at a high marginal tax rate to obtain benefits which instead attract fringe benefit tax at a lower rate, and therefore cost the employee less than if they had used after-tax salary to obtain the same benefit.

Salary sacrificed earnings from benefits other than superannuation refers to benefits obtained under a salary sacrificing agreement other than superannuation (e.g. motor vehicles, laptop computers). This is the actual salary foregone by employees.</link:label>

Salaries are defined as regular payments, usually monthly, which are made by an employer under a contract of employment to an employee. Wages and salaries refer to payments made to all permanent, part-time and temporary employees on the payroll during the reporting period.

Share based payments refers to company shares/stocks that are issued to employees as part of their remuneration package. The shares are usually issued on a conditional basis (e.g. the company reaches or exceeds its target for the reporting period).

The reason for the difference between reporting periods is the cause or events that have resulted in a variation of greater than 10 percent from the value reported in the previous reporting period.</link:label>
