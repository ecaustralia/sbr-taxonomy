The contingent loss method uses simulation techniques to calculate capital charge of an option portfolio for changes in the level and volatility of the prices of its associated underlyings. Under this approach, the capital charge is determined by the largest loss produced by a scenario 'matrix' (i.e. a specified combination of underlying asset price and volatility changes).</link:label>

The delta-plus method uses the sensitivity parameters associated with options to measure their market risk capital requirements. Under this method, the delta-equivalent position of each option becomes part of the standard methodology, with the delta-equivalent amount subject to the applicable general market risk charges.

Entities using this method must first calculate delta-equivalent position of each option by multiplying the market value of the underlying position by the absolute value of the delta calculated on that position.</link:label>
